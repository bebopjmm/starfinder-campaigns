## Abilities

### Racial

- **Blindsense**: Shirrens’ sense vibrations in the air—out to 30 feet. A shirren ignores the Stealth bonuses from any form of visual camouflage, invisibility, and the like when attempting a Perception check opposed by a creature’s Stealth check.
  - Even on a successful Perception check, any foe that can’t be seen still has total concealment (50% miss chance) against a shirren, and the shirren still has the normal miss chance when attacking foes that have concealment.
  - A shirren is still flat-footed against attacks from creatures it can’t see.
- **Communalism**: Once per day, as long as an ally is within 10 feet, a shirren can roll a single attack roll or skill check twice and take the higher result.
- **Cultural Fascination**: +2 racial bonus to Culture and Diplomacy checks.
- **Limited Telepathy**: Shirrens can communicate telepathically with any creatures within 30 feet with whom they share a language. Conversing telepathically with multiple creatures simultaneously is just as difficult as listening to multiple people speak.

### Scholar

- **Theme Knowledge**: T'semkish is an expert Life Science (xenobiology) and his passion for the subject shows.
  - Reduce the DC of skill checks to recall knowledge about your specialty is reduced by 5.
  - Your chosen skill is a class skill for you, though if it is a class skill from the class you take at 1st level, you instead gain a +1 bonus to checks with your chosen skill.

### Mystic

- **Healing Touch (5hp)**: Once per day, T'semkish can spend 10 minutes to magically heal an ally up to 5hp per mystic level.
- **Xenodruid Connection**
  - **Speak With Animals**: T'semkish can communicate with any creature of the animal type, though this doesn’t make it friendly.
    - If an animal is friendly toward him, it may do him favors
    - T'semkish can use Intimidate to bully animals, and can use any other language-dependent effect against animals.
  - **Channel Skill (+1)**: Life Science, Survival

### Feats

- **Mystic Strike**: T'semkish's melee and ranged attacks count as magic for the purposes of bypassing damage reduction and other situations, such as attacking incorporeal creatures.
