## Abilities

### Racial

- **Armor Savant**: Vesk use armor in a way that complements their uniquely sturdy physiology.
  - +1 racial bonus to AC when wearing armor.
  - armor check penalty for heavy armor is 1 less severe than normal.
- **Fearless**: +2 racial bonus to saving throws against fear effects.
- **Low-light Vision**: Vesk can see in dim light as if it were normal light.
- **Natural Weapons**: Vesk are always considered armed.
  - deal 1d3 lethal damage with unarmed strikes and the attack doesn’t count as archaic.
  - Vesk gain a unique weapon specialization with their natural weapons at 3rd level, allowing them to add 1.5x their character level to their damage rolls for their natural weapons.

### Outlaw

- **Theme Knowledge**: Jogadan is well connected to shadowy secrets and back-alley deals, and he both knows about key players and has handy skills of his own.
  - Reduce the DC of Culture checks to recall knowledge about the criminal underworld by 5.
  - Sleight of Hand is a class skill for you, though if it is a class skill from the class you take at 1st level, you instead gain a +1 bonus to Sleight of Hand checks.

### Solarian

- **Skill Adept**: proficient in Sleight of Hand and Survival
- **Solar Weapon**: Jogadan can seize his solar mote in one hand to form a doshko out of glowing stellar energy. Solarian weapon crystals can be applied.
  - solar weapon deals damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier.
  - Forming or dismissing a solar weapon is a move action that takes the same amount of effort as drawing or sheathing a weapon (and can be combined with a move as a single move action or used with the Quick Draw feat).
  - solar weapon is automatically dismissed if it ever leaves your hand.
  - No other creature or effect can affect your solar manifestation in any way, including disarming or sundering it.
- **Stellar Mode**: Stellar mode can only be activated and remain active when Jogadan is in combat facing a significant enemy.
	- **Graviton Mode**: Upon entering graviton mode, Jogadan gains 1 graviton attunement point and becomes graviton-attuned, 3 points for fully attuned. Some of his stellar revelations are graviton powers and get stronger when he's graviton-attuned.
    - +1 insight bonus to Reflex saves.
	- **Photon Mode**: Upon entering photon mode, Jogadan gain 1 photon attunement point and become photon-attuned, 3 points for fully attuned. Some of his stellar revelations are photon powers and get stronger when he's photon-attuned.
    - +1 insight bonus to damage rolls (including damage rolls for your stellar powers).
	- **Unattuned**: While unattuned, Jogadan gains no attunement points and he is neither photon-attuned nor graviton-attuned. He loses all attunement points accrued so far and gains no benefits while unattuned.
  - **Stellar Revelation**:
  	- **Black Hole**: When Jogadan is fully graviton-attuned, as a standard action, he can pull any number of creatures within 20 feet of you closer. He chooses which creatures are affected and which ones aren’t. Each target must succeed at a **DC12 Fortitude** save or be pulled 10 feet toward him.
      - Solid objects do not block this ability, but any creature that runs into a solid object ceases moving closer to him.
      - Creatures moved by this ability do not provoke attacks of opportunity from this movement.
  		- After you use this revelation, he immediately becomes unattuned.
  		- Black hole functions as a zenith revelation for the purposes of abilities that reference them.
  	- **Supernova (2d6 F)**: When Jogadan is fully photon-attuned, as a standard action, he can deal fire damage to all creatures within 10 feet of him.
      - A creature that succeeds at a **DC12 Reflex** save takes half damage.
  		- After you use this revelation, he immediately becomes unattuned.
