## Abilities

### Racial

- **Skilled**: +1 skill rank at each level

### Spacefarer

- **Theme Knowledge**: Bran is obsessed with distant worlds, and he always mentally catalogs everything he learns about new and strange places so he can recall it when he needs it most. Additionally, he uses your knowledge of biology and topology to inure himself to alien hazards.
  - Reduce the DC of Physical Science checks to recall knowledge about strange new worlds or features of space by 5.
  - Physical Science is a class skill

### Envoy

- **Expertise** (+1d6): insight bonus to Sense Motive checks
  - **Skill Expertise**: expertise insight bonus to Diplomacy checks
- **Envoy Improvisation (DC 13)**: little tricks that bolster allies, confound enemies, or change the ebb and flow of battle using guile, inspiration, or luck.
  - **Fire Support**: When Bran takes a standard action to provide harrying fire and hits the AC of 15 required to do so, he also provide covering fire for the next ally attacked by the target of his harrying fire attacks before your next turn. Additionally, as a full action, Bran can make two ranged attack rolls against two different targets, taking a â€“4 penalty to each attack roll, to apply harrying fire to each target hit. For each target that he successfully applies harrying fire to, he also provides covering fire for the next ally that is attacked by either target before his next turn.

### Feats

- **Weapon Focus (small arms)**: +1 attack bonus with small arms
- **Veiled Threat**: Bran can be so subtle not even the people he threatens are entirely sure he threatened them.
  - When he successfully bullies a creature with the Intimidate skill, after the duration of its helpful attitude ends, its attitude becomes indifferent rather than hostile
