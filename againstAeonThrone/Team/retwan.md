## Abilities

### Racial

- **Desert Stride**:Kasathas can move through nonmagical difficult terrain in deserts, hills, and mountains at their normal speed.
- **Four-armed**:Kasathas have four arms, which allows them to wield and hold up to four hands’ worth of weapons and equipment. While their multiple arms increase the number of items they can have at the ready, it doesn't increase the number of attacks they can make during combat.
- **Historian**:+2 racial bonus to Culture checks.
- **Natural Grace**: +2 racial bonus to Acrobatics and Athletics checks.

### Bounty Hunter

-  **Theme Knowledge**: Retwan's mind is a cold steel trap when it comes to scraps of information about the creatures they're tracking down. Choose a specific sentient creature that can be identify by name, alias, or specific identity to be Retwan's mark.
  - Reduce the DC of Culture or Profession (bounty hunter) checks to recall knowledge about your mark, as well as to recall knowledge about law-enforcement individuals and practices, by 5.
  - If the mark is known only by an alias or secret identity, this ability helps Retwan learn facts only about the identity known, not any other unknown identities.
  - Once a mark is defeated, as an action that takes 1 minute, Retwan can study dossiers and database information about another individual to be their new mark. Retwan can instead abandon his mark for a new one without defeating it, but if he does so, he take a –2 penalty to all skill checks for 1 week.
  - +1 bonus to Survival checks.

### Soldier (Hit-and-Run)

- **Opening Volley**: Retwan's ranged assault leaves his foes disoriented and vulnerable to his next melee attack.
  - Whenever Retwan deals damage to an opponent with a ranged attack on his first turn in a combat, he gains a +2 circumstance bonus to his next melee attack roll against that opponent. This melee attack must occur before the end of his next turn.

### Feats

- **Weapon Focus (advanced melee weapons)**: +1 attack bonus with advanced melee weapons
