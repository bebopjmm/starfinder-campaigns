# Against the Aeon Throne: Ch 1, Prologue

## Absalom Station

While wrapping up a bounty mission in the Diaspora, the team received ship comms that AbadarCorp has a delivery job for them. After four days of drift travel, the team arrived at Absalom Station, and the meeting with AbadarCorp was scheduled for the following morning.

### AbadarCorp

A functionary escoted the team to the office of Ms. Vamaza, a female lashunta. A shireen in Xenowarden garb was also in the office. Ms. Vamaza explained the mission:
- supply delivery to Vast colony site, Madelon's Landing, on Nakondis.
- fee of 5000cr to be paid by the colony's head administrator Madelon Kesi.
- mentioned that this crew was specifically recommended

There was an additional component, the Xenowardens requested passage of the shirren, T'semkish to the planet.
- additional 1000cr, half upfront
- Madelon Kesi will pay remainder

The team agreed and the contracts were signed. Ms Vamaza informed them that the supplies would be loaded aboard the *Swift Venture* by the end of the day.
