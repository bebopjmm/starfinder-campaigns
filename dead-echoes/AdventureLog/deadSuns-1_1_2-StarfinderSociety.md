## The Starfinder Society
![Lorespire Complex](https://www.dropbox.com/s/iy6vrfuobs97ake/lorespireComplex.jpg?raw=1)  
The team reached the Lorespire Complex around mid-afternoon, traveling by robo-taxi from the Arms to the Ring sector. Enroute, Cyscokt ensured that the others were aware that Chiskisk was neither male nor female, but host, the third shirren sex, and as such was referred to with the pronouns “they,” “them,” and “themself.” Checking in with the receptionist and requesting to see Chiskisk, the team was directed toward a small waiting room and politely asked to wait. After several minutes, a functionary arrived to lead them to a cluttered but clean office deep in the complex.

Seated behind a polished and unadorned plastic desk, a shirren garbed in understated business clothes nervously flexed their antennae from side to side—a shirren expression of perplexity. They stood, welcomed the group, and introduced themselves. After offering the group refreshments of filtered water and processed-protein wafers, the shirren bid them sit down.
>"Welcome to Starfinder Society Headquarters new recruits. We are pleased that you have expressed an interest in joining our esteemed organization, but must confess some confusion. Duravor Kreel was supposed to bring you here and provide your orientation. Where is he?"

After Gereon shared the tragic news of the gangfight at Dock 94 and Duravor's death, Chiskisk switched to speaking telepathically in the recruits' heads,

> "We am sorry that we cannot welcome you to Absalom Station under better circumstances. We assure you that such attacks are a rare occurrence, though we realize that is likely small comfort to you. We are pleased that none of you were seriously hurt, but grieve for Duravor’s death. He was a valued member of the Society, and a friend. May the Lady of Graves be kind in her judgment of his soul.”

The shirren bowed their head momentarily, then looked up, their compound eyes glittering. Cyscokt inquired if Chiskisk knew Durarvor well, to which they replied,

>"We had worked with Duravor for many years. He was a midranking member of the Starfinder Society and most of his work focused on mineral prospecting, but he also took an interest in mentoring new and prospective members of the Society. After his sister's tragic death a few year's back in a mining accident, the Starfinder Society became the closest thing he had left to family. Duravor will be greatly missed by many here. What puzzles us most is the reason behind this attack.”

Chiskisk tapped a few commands into their computer, studied the results, and then continued.

>“Yes, according to the incident report just released by station security, two gangs were involved in the attack: the Downside Kings and the Level 21 Crew, just as you said. Gang wars are not uncommon on the station, but they usually confine themselves to the more lawless sectors like the Puddles. It is rare for street gangs to battle openly in public areas like the docks. We cannot help but wonder whether all is as it seems. There must be a reason why those two gangs were at Docking Bay 94 at that time—the time of your arrival, coincidentally. But was it coincidence? Were you and Duravor just innocent bystanders caught in the crossfire, or might you and he have been specifically targeted? And if so, why?
>
>“Our understanding is that you are interested in becoming Starfinders, and since you were witnesses to the attack, we would like to ask you to investigate the incident on behalf of the Society. Find out exactly what happened and why. It may simply be a matter of being in the wrong place at the wrong time—we have no doubt station security will rule it so—but if Duravor was murdered, we would like to find justice for my friend.

Taraea expressed her enthusiasm about the opportunity, and Nevos-4 added that such brazen attacks could not be ignored. Cyscokt sounded a cautionary tone, however,
>"We must be sure that it is justice that we pursue and not vengeance"

Chiskisk allayed Cyscokt's concerns, asserting that they are not implying or encouraging a violent resolution; the society was not the Hellknights after all. Gereon turned the conversation toward more practical matters, foremost that many of the team had just arrived at the station and resources would be required to tackle the assignment.

Resuming tapping at their computer, Chiskisk responded,
>"Yes, naturally. We have created a Starfinder account that your team will be able to access and transferred a total of one thousand credits into it as ... let us say, signing bonus plus expenses. As new recruits, the society secured a week of efficiency lodging for each of you at the Moons of Sleep. The hotel is centrally located just a short walk from the parks and towers of the Eye, and if you wish to extend your stay there, they provide a discount to Starfinders. Lastly, we have transferred a comms code to you that will allow you to contact us as you make progress."

Nisk requested Duravor's home address to check for clues and after a moment's thought Chiskisk agreed, sending them the address of a small apartment in the Drifter's End neighborhood of the Ring sector. As the team stood to depart, Chiskisk gave some parting thoughts,

>"This assignment will give you the opportunity to demonstrate your own skills and abilities and show the Society that you are worthy of the title ‘Starfinder.’ We wish you good luck.”

Outside the Lorespire Complex, the team decided to check out the Duravor's apartment before going to the Moons of Sleep.

## Duravor's Apartment

Drifter's Edge was an easily walkable distance from the Lorespire Complex. Using Duravor's infoPad to gain entry, they found that the dwarf lived in a small, very unkempt efficiency apartment.

Spotting a computer terminal in the living area, Nisk got to work while the others searched the rest of the apartment. Cyscokt focused on the kitchenette and came to the conclusion that Duravor subsisted on beer and takeout, favoring a restaurant called Mama Fats.

*Taraea finds a curious token amongst his possessions*

- Nisk has quite a bit of success scanning through the computer files
	- Duravor was a native of the Diaspora, the diffuse asteroid belt between Verces and Eox, and was known to have ties to dwarves and other mining groups in the region. An outspoken champion of miners’ rights, Kreel was active in challenging large corporate interests that exploited individual miners and laborers, including Astral Extractions.
	- Kreel had personally invested money in the Hardscrabble Collective. In addition, one of his cousins was a member of the group, but she died in a mining accident—the result of safety violations perpetrated by her contract employer, Astral Extractions.
- Gereon is familiar with Astral Extractions
	- Astral Extractions is a powerful mining conglomerate with business ties throughout the Pact Worlds. Most of the company’s operations are centered in the Diaspora and the rocky moons of the outer planets, but it has also begun sending scout vessels into the Vast in search of new claims. The company recently hired one of the Hardscrabble Collective’s ships, the Acreon, for one of these exploratory missions.
	- The public face of Astral Extractions is that of an ethical and respectable corporation, but outside of the public eye, some say the company uses hired muscle—corporate mercenaries, strikebreakers, and even criminal elements—as proxies to intimidate and threaten those who stand in its way.
- Gereon is not very familiar with Hardscrabble
	- The Hardscrabble Collective is a clan of stubborn asteroid miners that operates primarily among the scattered planetoids of the Diaspora. It has no offices or base of operations, but the clan members usually view the Armada—the ever-changing fleet of ships that orbit Absalom Station—as a central gathering place. Collective crews hire their ships out to a wide variety of business concerns, including Astral Extractions, which recently employed the Collective ship Acreon to scout for new mining prospects in the Vast.

Nisk recommends checking out a couple of the local watering holes — they may be able get some additional info on Duravor.

## Paralax Cantina

On the third try, the team found a local establishment where Duravor was a well-known regular. Once folks learned of Duravor's death, an impromptu wake commences.

- lots of confirmation of what team had learned about Duravor, but no new real insights.
- After a few drinks, the team gets some of the regular's to open up about the Hardscrabble Collective
	- While the Hardscrabble Collective calls itself a clan, it is more of a cooperative business enterprise, a coalition of dozens of ships’ crews who have banded together for mutual bene t and safety. While some of the Collective’s members are related, most of them are individuals from a dozen different races: humans, dwarves, androids, ysoki, and more. Nevertheless, the Hardscrabble Collective is as tightly knit as many families, and members  fiercely look after one another’s welfare.
	- Following the arrival of the Acreon and Astral Extractions’ claim on the ship and the Drift Rock, the Hardscrabble Collective contracted with an Absalom Station street gang called the Level 21 Crew to protect its members and its interests on the station until the dispute can be resolved.
- This opened discussion to Level-21 Crew
	- The Level 21 Crew may be a criminal gang, but they have a reputation in their territory (and neighboring levels) for promoting community empowerment, and many neighborhood residents tolerate or tacitly endorse their activities. The gang has also been known to hire itself out to defend marginalized and threatened groups or factions. A grizzled ysoki called Jabaxa currently leads the Level 21 Crew.
	- Fearing retribution from powerful corporate interests, the Hardscrabble Collective has recently hired the Level 21 Crew for protection.
- Talk of the Acreon and the Drift Rock spur lots of wild speculation and rumors.

The drinking and remembrances run well into the wee hours of the next morning, and the team ends up crashing at some nearby sleep pods.
