# Dead Suns 1.2: Ghost Ship, Ch 1

## A New Assignment

About a week after the Fusion Queen raid, a messenger arrives at the Moons of Sleep with an invitation (printed on paper that is as black as the void of space) requesting their company for a meeting with His Excellency Gevalarsk Nor, the ambassador of Eox.

- Nevos-4 not familiar with elebrians of Eox
- Gereon, Nisk, and Cyscokt recognizes Gevalarsk Nor as the head of Eox’s diplomatic delegation to the Pact Council.
  - the d'Amboise family has had business dealing with Eox before (opposing)

The team travels to the Eoxian embassy in Absalom Station’s wealthy Parkside neighborhood in the Eye.
- The embassy is normally restricted to Eoxian citizens and foreigners with official business, but the PCs’ invitation gives them authorization to enter.

Inside, the Eoxian embassy has been decorated in a style reminiscent of traditional Eoxian architecture—black marble and bone-pale limestone, vaulted ceilings, sepulchral furnishings, and disconcertingly organic architectural details. Inside, a pair of undead skeletal attendants lead the team to a spare but well-appointed office that feels something like the inside of an ancient mausoleum.

### The Ambassador

The office is that of Eox’s ambassador to Absalom Station, Gevalarsk Nor. Nor’s elongated cranium marks him as an elebrian, a native of Eox, and he is clearly undead—his skeletal countenance displays no scrap of flesh, and an eerie light burns in his otherwise empty eye sockets. Nor greets the PCs and offers them seats. Once they’re comfortable, he addresses them.

>  “Thank you for agreeing to meet with me. I’m certain you’re aware of the recent interest in the prospecting ship Acreon and the asteroid being referred to as the ‘Drift Rock,’ and I believe you’re also acquainted with the dispute between Astral Extractions and the Hardscrabble Collective over both the ship and the asteroid. Both parties are currently awaiting legal arbitration, but the wheels of justice often turn quite slowly. As a result, I have offered my services as a mediator in hopes of finding a solution that is equitable to both factions.
>
>“The first step in this, of course, is learning the specifics of the opposing claims.
>
>“I would like you to go to the Acreon, find out precisely what happened to its crew, and ascertain the value of its asteroid cargo, as well as determine whether this Drift Rock is truly as ‘mysterious’ as the media claims.”

- Gereon: Curious why Nor wants them
  - Nor:
  >"Reports of your recent endeavors in dealing with some of Absalom Station’s most notorious gangs have led me to believe that you might be useful in this undertaking as well. You’re new to the station, you seem to possess a wide range of skills and abilities, and you certainly appear capable. In short, you’re perfectly positioned as a neutral third party that could cut through all of the red tape surrounding this issue and get to the heart of the matter. Of course, the irony of the d'Amboise scion undertaking an assignment at our bequest is not lost on me"

- Taraea: As new SF initiates, an investigation of this sort seems to fall within their charter
- Cyscokt: Agrees, but is curious as the why the head of the Eoxian delegation has become involved in what seems a minor, if hyper publicized dispute.
  - Nor:
  >"I couldn't have reached my current position without a resolute belief in the power of diplomacy. I have no ties to either faction, and the tragic violence that has occurred due to the introduction of gangs as proxies for the disputing parties is unacceptable. Absalom Station has become as much a home for me as Eox, and if my skills can prevent further escalation and violence, then I am more than happy to help."

- Nevos-4: The Acreon is currently under quarantined
  - Nor tells them that he has already received permission from station security to send an exploratory team to the Acreon and that he has arranged for the team to use one of the station’s shuttles for transport as soon as they are ready.

- Nisk: Presses on Nor's personal interest in the matter
  - Nor:
  >"There is one additional detail that I’d like to ask your help with,” Nor says, steepling his bony fingers. “Among its other cargo, the Acreon was carrying a package destined for the embassy. Of course, with the ship being quarantined, the package has been undeliverable. I’ve been eagerly awaiting its arrival, and I’d consider it a personal favor if you could find the package and bring it to me when you return to the station. It’s clearly marked, so I don’t imagine it will be too difficult to find."
  - Nisk pushes on the nature of the cargo, but Nor declines to give specifics, but assures the PCs that it contains no contraband and that there are no illegalities involved. He’s simply asking them to retrieve his personal property from the ship.

The team states that they need to clear the assignment with SFS. Nisk broaches the topic of fee - this is a high risk operation.

- Nor offers 600cr to each member for the assignment, and an additional 500cr for deliverying his cargo.

### Chiskisk

Departing the Eoxian embassy the team heads to the Lorespire. Chiskisk is availble for a brief meeting.

- Chiskisk is very supportive of the team taking the mission. In light of recent events, the Starfinder Society has become interested in learning more about the Acreon and the Drift Rock, and any discoveries the PCs might make during their explorations could increase their prestige in the Society and possibly earn them greater opportunities in the future.
- Nevos-4 wants to know how much trust can be put into the Eoxians
  - Chiskisk perspective is that Eoxians are not considered enemies, and are just as worthy of trust as any other sentient species in the Pact Worlds.
  - Gereon cautions the team to be wary, high level politicains always have motives of self-interest
  - Nisk is uneasy about this special cargo that Nor wants delivered

### Job accepted

The team contacts Nor, who is delighted to hear that they are accepting the assignment.
- tells them that the ship he has arranged for them, the Hippocampus, will be available the following morning at Dock 73.
- recommends the team investigate the Acreon first, to see if they can find any traces of the ship’s crew, before they begin exploring the Drift Rock.

### Mission Prep

Shopping trip to gear up, so off to Diamond Defense and Surplus. In addition to ammunition and basic gear, some members got upgrades:
- Nevos-4: traded ceremonial plate for hidden soldier armor and got anchoring fusion installed on auto cannon
- Gereon: traded flight suit for second skin
- Taraea: traded long sword for tactical pike

## Factional Influences

### Astral Investigations

While purchasing new gear at Diamond's, the team received a message from a Ms Joss, Astral Investigations Relations Executive, asking them to attend a private meeting at the corporate headquarters in Bluerise Tower. Intrigued, the team accepts. Ms. Joss warmly greets the team and thanks them for agreeing to meet. The purpose of the meeting, Ms. Joss informs them, is to give the PCs a better sense of Astral Extractions’ corporate philosophy and how that informs the company’s business dealings. She begins with a slickly produced marketing presentation that highlights Astral Extractions’ efforts in discovering, developing, and managing much-needed natural resources from across the galaxy and selling them in the Pact Worlds.
- It’s clear that the presentation is marketing material for investors and the public, but there’s nothing outright false about the claims made.

Having established the noble services that Astral Extractions provides for companies and citizens throughout the Pact Worlds, Ms. Joss recounts details of the company’s contract with the Hardscrabble Collective—namely, that the Acreon was hired to prospect for unclaimed, unexploited mineral resources on behalf of Astral Extractions, which would then hold all rights and claims to those discoveries. Ms. Joss states that Astral Extractions simply wants what their contract gives them rights to. The Acreon found the Drift Rock—an unclaimed, unexploited mineral resource, as defined in the contract—while working for Astral Extractions, so rights to the asteroid belong to the company.
- Gereon calls out that certainly seems to be a plausible interpretation of the contract’s terms, but it’s also evident that the contract assumes the Acreon’s crew would simply identify sites for future development by the company. It’s less clear how the terms of the contract might apply to a more portable potential resource—such as a small asteroid that could be brought with the ship itself.

In any event, after presenting her case to the group, Ms. Joss simply asks them to carefully consider the merits of Astral Extractions’ claim and keep open minds while investigating the ship and asteroid. Astral Extractions will, of course, accept the results of Ambassador Nor’s mediation, but Ms. Joss does mention that the company is always interested in hiring competent freelancers for a variety of tasks, and hints—obliquely, of course—that the team could find lucrative employment opportunities in the future if their findings support Astral Extractions’ claims.
- Taraea makes it clear that she cannot be bought off in this manner

### Hardscrabble Collective

As the team is leaving the Astral Investigations corporate headquarters, they receive a message from Otal Serissi, inviting the team to visit his ship, the Dust Runner, out in the Armada. A shuttle is available and waiting at Dock 153.

A red-skinned human from Akiton, Captain Serissi is also something of an unofficial spokesman for the Hardscrabble Collective, and he wants the PCs to better understand what the Collective stands for. The Dust Runner is a working tramp freighter, practical and utilitarian, with little in the way of luxury or even comfort. Yet Captain Serissi takes great pride in his ship—which is also his home and his livelihood—a fact that is plainly evident as he affably escorts the PCs on a tour of the vessel.

Afterward, Serissi sits down with the PCs in the galley, and over cups of hot black coffee, explains why the fate of the Acreon, and especially its crew, is so important to the Hardscrabble Collective. The Collective’s members aren’t rich; most of them scratch out whatever meager livings they can from the rocks of the Diaspora, so the occasional corporate contract—like the Acreon’s contract with Astral Extractions— is an opportunity few have the luxury to refuse. But the Collective values its independence and freedom greatly, and it constantly struggles against exploitation and even takeovers at the hands of would-be corporate overlords. It’s clear that the crew of the Acreon staked their own claim on the Drift Rock, believing that the terms of their contract allowed them to do so. Is it any surprise that the Hardscrabble Collective would be suspicious of Astral Extractions’ attempts to lay sole claim to the Acreon and the Drift Rock following the mysterious circumstances of their arrival at Absalom Station?

The members of the Hardscrabble Collective call themselves a clan, and they mean it. Once you join, you’re family. Members look out for each other, defend each other, and care for each other. The Collective doesn’t know what value, if any, the Drift Rock might have, but they know the worth of their brothers and sisters on the Acreon. They need to know what happened to the Acreon’s crew, as any family needs to know the fate of their loved ones. And if the worst has happened, then perhaps whatever wealth the Drift Rock holds can help ease the loss of the families left behind. That’s all they really care about.

Captain Serissi tells the PCs that the Hardscrabble Collective isn’t disputing Astral Extractions’ contract with the Acreon; they’re happy to turn all of the files and findings from the ship’s prospecting mission over to the company, but the ship, and the claim its crew staked on the Drift Rock, belong to the Collective. Before ferrying the PCs back to Absalom Station, Serissi wishes them good luck on their investigation of the Acreon and implores them to do their best to find out what happened to the ship’s crew.

- Nevos-4 asks if Capt Serrissi has the floorplan schematics of the Acreon. The captain transfers the data to the team.

### Starfinder Society factions

Each of the factions reach out to different team members  with an objective

- Exo-guardians reach out to Nevos-4: eradication of any immediate threats on Acreon or Drift Rock and identify any broader threat
- Wayfinders reach out to Cyscokt and Taraea: does the Drift Rock hold clues to anything of interest
- Second-seekers reach out to Gereon: emphasis on this mission will likely be high profile and SFS needs to be shown in the best light possible
- Datafiles reach out to Nisk: collect and report any and all information related to the Acreon and Drift Rock to faction first.
