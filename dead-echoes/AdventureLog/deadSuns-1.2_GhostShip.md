# Dead Suns 1.2: Ghost Ship, Ch 1

## A New Assignment

About a week after the Fusion Queen raid, a messenger arrives at the Moons of Sleep with an invitation (printed on paper that is as black as the void of space) requesting their company for a meeting with His Excellency Gevalarsk Nor, the ambassador of Eox.

- Nevos-4 not familiar with elebrians of Eox
- Gereon, Nisk, and Cyscokt recognizes Gevalarsk Nor as the head of Eox’s diplomatic delegation to the Pact Council.
  - the d'Amboise family has had business dealing with Eox before (opposing)

The team travels to the Eoxian embassy in Absalom Station’s wealthy Parkside neighborhood in the Eye.
- The embassy is normally restricted to Eoxian citizens and foreigners with official business, but the PCs’ invitation gives them authorization to enter.

Inside, the Eoxian embassy has been decorated in a style reminiscent of traditional Eoxian architecture—black marble and bone-pale limestone, vaulted ceilings, sepulchral furnishings, and disconcertingly organic architectural details. Inside, a pair of undead skeletal attendants lead the team to a spare but well-appointed office that feels something like the inside of an ancient mausoleum.

### The Ambassador

The office is that of Eox’s ambassador to Absalom Station, Gevalarsk Nor. Nor’s elongated cranium marks him as an elebrian, a native of Eox, and he is clearly undead—his skeletal countenance displays no scrap of flesh, and an eerie light burns in his otherwise empty eye sockets. Nor greets the PCs and offers them seats. Once they’re comfortable, he addresses them.

>  “Thank you for agreeing to meet with me. I’m certain you’re aware of the recent interest in the prospecting ship Acreon and the asteroid being referred to as the ‘Drift Rock,’ and I believe you’re also acquainted with the dispute between Astral Extractions and the Hardscrabble Collective over both the ship and the asteroid. Both parties are currently awaiting legal arbitration, but the wheels of justice often turn quite slowly. As a result, I have offered my services as a mediator in hopes of finding a solution that is equitable to both factions.
>
>“The first step in this, of course, is learning the specifics of the opposing claims.
>
>“I would like you to go to the Acreon, find out precisely what happened to its crew, and ascertain the value of its asteroid cargo, as well as determine whether this Drift Rock is truly as ‘mysterious’ as the media claims.”

- Gereon: Curious why Nor wants them
  - Nor:
  >"Reports of your recent endeavors in dealing with some of Absalom Station’s most notorious gangs have led me to believe that you might be useful in this undertaking as well. You’re new to the station, you seem to possess a wide range of skills and abilities, and you certainly appear capable. In short, you’re perfectly positioned as a neutral third party that could cut through all of the red tape surrounding this issue and get to the heart of the matter. Of course, the irony of the d'Amboise scion undertaking an assignment at our bequest is not lost on me"

- Taraea: As new SF initiates, an investigation of this sort seems to fall within their charter
- Cyscokt: Agrees, but is curious as the why the head of the Eoxian delegation has become involved in what seems a minor, if hyper publicized dispute.
  - Nor:
  >"I couldn't have reached my current position without a resolute belief in the power of diplomacy. I have no ties to either faction, and the tragic violence that has occurred due to the introduction of gangs as proxies for the disputing parties is unacceptable. Absalom Station has become as much a home for me as Eox, and if my skills can prevent further escalation and violence, then I am more than happy to help."

- Nevos-4: The Acreon is currently under quarantined
  - Nor tells them that he has already received permission from station security to send an exploratory team to the Acreon and that he has arranged for the team to use one of the station’s shuttles for transport as soon as they are ready.

- Nisk: Presses on Nor's personal interest in the matter
  - Nor:
  >"There is one additional detail that I’d like to ask your help with,” Nor says, steepling his bony fingers. “Among its other cargo, the Acreon was carrying a package destined for the embassy. Of course, with the ship being quarantined, the package has been undeliverable. I’ve been eagerly awaiting its arrival, and I’d consider it a personal favor if you could find the package and bring it to me when you return to the station. It’s clearly marked, so I don’t imagine it will be too difficult to find."
  - Nisk pushes on the nature of the cargo, but Nor declines to give specifics, but assures the PCs that it contains no contraband and that there are no illegalities involved. He’s simply asking them to retrieve his personal property from the ship.

The team states that they need to clear the assignment with SFS. Nisk broaches the topic of fee - this is a high risk operation.

- Nor offers 600cr to each member for the assignment, and an additional 500cr for deliverying his cargo.

### Chiskisk

Departing the Eoxian embassy the team heads to the Lorespire. Chiskisk is availble for a brief meeting.

- Chiskisk is very supportive of the team taking the mission. In light of recent events, the Starfinder Society has become interested in learning more about the Acreon and the Drift Rock, and any discoveries the PCs might make during their explorations could increase their prestige in the Society and possibly earn them greater opportunities in the future.
- Nevos-4 wants to know how much trust can be put into the Eoxians
  - Chiskisk perspective is that Eoxians are not considered enemies, and are just as worthy of trust as any other sentient species in the Pact Worlds.
  - Gereon cautions the team to be wary, high level politicains always have motives of self-interest
  - Nisk is uneasy about this special cargo that Nor wants delivered

### Job accepted

The team contacts Nor, who is delighted to hear that they are accepting the assignment.
- tells them that the ship he has arranged for them, the Hippocampus, will be available the following morning at Dock 73.
- recommends the team investigate the Acreon first, to see if they can find any traces of the ship’s crew, before they begin exploring the Drift Rock.

### Mission Prep

Shopping trip to gear up, so off to Diamond Defense and Surplus.
