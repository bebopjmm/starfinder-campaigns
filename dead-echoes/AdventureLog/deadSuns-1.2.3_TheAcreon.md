# Dead Suns 1.2: Ghost Ship, Ch 3

## Boarding

No light initially, rely totally on dim light of ship emergency lights.

*Marching Order*
1. Nevos-4 , Nisk
2. Gereon, Taraea
3. Cyscokt

As soon as the airlock door opened into the ship, flickering emergency lights did little to dispel the darkness inside the derelict ship, and the sense of abandonment was only heightened by the apparent lack of any movement or life inside its airless corridors. Artificial gravity still functioned, however, so there was likely still power to run essential systems and possibly restore life support and atmosphere to the ship. Unfortunately, there were still no obvious clues as to the fate of the Acreonâ€™s vanished crew.

Nevos-4 and Nisk spotted a small body in a space suit sprawled on the floor in the middle of a junction in the hallway.. Cautiously the team approached, Nisk turning on her flashlight so that Cyscokt could examine the remains. As soon as Cyscokt reached the body, the shirren stiffened and warned over the comms,
>"Something's coming down the hall!"

### Corridor Akata Encounter
Nisk and Cyscokt are not surprised

#### Surprise round
- akata closes on cyscokt and Nisk
- nisk tumbled out of range of the akata, drawing her semi-auto pistol
- cyscokt took a guarded step back

#### Round 1
- akata closes on nevos-4 and cyscokt, biting nevos-4 for 6dmg
  - nevos-4 resists disease
- nisk relocates, failing trick attack but hits akata for 5dmg
- gereon issues *Get'em* on akata and attempts laser pistol shot (nevos-4 soft cover), but just missiles
- taraea activates her solar armor and photon attunes(1) and stabs at akata with pike, missing
- nevos-4 grabs his assault hammer and hits 3dmg
- cyscokt studies the creature while taking guarded step back
  - shares that the creature is an akata, a space predator that is susceptible to salt water

#### Round 2
- akata presses attack on nevos-4, but misses
- nisk fails trick attack and misses akata
- gereon won't risk the shot, but issues *Get'em*
- taraea steps up and stabs akata with pike, 6dmg , photon attunement(2)
- nevos-4 swings again with hammer, but misses
- cyscokt unleashes shooting stars to kill akata, 8dmg

#### Development
- studying the dead akata, Taraea recalls that these creatures are resistant to fire damage, so laser pistols probably won't be much use.
- cyscokt resumes inspection of the corpse and identifies that it is a space goblin
  - no space goblins were part of the Acreon crew manifest

So far all the viewable ship doors are locked in the open position, including the bridge.

## Advance to bridge
