# Dead Suns 1.2: Ghost Ship, Ch 3

## Boarding

No light initially, rely totally on dim light of ship emergency lights.

*Marching Order*
1. Nevos-4 , Nisk
2. Gereon, Taraea
3. Cyscokt

As soon as the airlock door opened into the ship, flickering emergency lights did little to dispel the darkness inside the derelict ship, and the sense of abandonment was only heightened by the apparent lack of any movement or life inside its airless corridors. Artificial gravity still functioned, however, so there was likely still power to run essential systems and possibly restore life support and atmosphere to the ship. Unfortunately, there were still no obvious clues as to the fate of the Acreon’s vanished crew.

Nevos-4 and Nisk spotted a small body in a space suit sprawled on the floor in the middle of a junction in the hallway.. Cautiously the team approached, Nisk turning on her flashlight so that Cyscokt could examine the remains. As soon as Cyscokt reached the body, the shirren stiffened and warned over the comms,
>"Something's coming down the hall!"

### Corridor Akata Encounter
Nisk and Cyscokt are not surprised

#### Surprise round
- akata closes on cyscokt and Nisk
- nisk tumbled out of range of the akata, drawing her semi-auto pistol
- cyscokt took a guarded step back

#### Round 1
- akata closes on nevos-4 and cyscokt, biting nevos-4 for 6dmg
  - nevos-4 resists disease
- nisk relocates, failing trick attack but hits akata for 5dmg
- gereon issues *Get'em* on akata and attempts laser pistol shot (nevos-4 soft cover), but just missiles
- taraea activates her solar armor and photon attunes(1) and stabs at akata with pike, missing
- nevos-4 grabs his assault hammer and hits 3dmg
- cyscokt studies the creature while taking guarded step back
  - shares that the creature is an akata, a space predator that is susceptible to salt water

#### Round 2
- akata presses attack on nevos-4, but misses
- nisk fails trick attack and misses akata
- gereon won't risk the shot, but issues *Get'em*
- taraea steps up and stabs akata with pike, 6dmg , photon attunement(2)
- nevos-4 swings again with hammer, but misses
- cyscokt unleashes shooting stars to kill akata, 8dmg

#### Development
- studying the dead akata, Taraea recalls that these creatures are resistant to fire damage, so laser pistols probably won't be much use.
- cyscokt resumes inspection of the corpse and identifies that it is a space goblin
  - Nisk verifies that no space goblins were part of the Acreon crew manifest

So far all the viewable ship doors are locked in the open position, including the bridge.

## Advance to bridge
Decide to stick to the plan an make directly for the bridge, but everyone extra alert.
- Gereon has his flashlight on as he an Taraea guard the rear as they approach the bridge.
- no one is surprised that more of the akatas are on the bridge

### Bridge Akata Encounter

#### Round 1
- Nevos-4 calls out north and moves in and fires at akata-1, hitting for 5dmg
- Gereon moves to bridge door and shines light on akata-1, issues *Get'em*
- akata 1&2 converge on Nevos-4 both biting for total of 12dmg
  - no infection
- akata-3 moves to doorway and bites Gereon for 4dmg
  - Gereon infected
- Nisk tumbles back drawing his pistol
- Taraea activates her stellar armor, shifts to photon attunement and stellar rushes akata-3
- cyscokt unleashes 3 shooting stars at akata-3 for 11dmg

#### Round 2
- Nevos-4 goes into total defense mode (22 KAC)
- Gereon takes a guarded step back and issues *Get'em* on akata-3
- akata 1&2 press their attack, but Nevos-4 fends them off
- akata-3 bites at Taraea but misses
- Nisk trick attack shot kills akata-3
- Taraea moves in to assist Nevos-4, photon attunement(2), flanking akata-2 and hitting with pike (7dmg)
- cyscokt moved into the Bridge

#### Round 3
- Nevos-4 maintained total defense mode, taunting the akatas
- Gereon moved into bridge and issued *Get'em* on akata-2
- akata-1 failed to bite Nevos-4
- akata-2 moved to bite Taraea (AoO) for 5dmg
  - AoO hit with pike for 5dmg
  - no infection
- Nisk trick attack shot kills akata-2
- Taraea hits akata-1 with pike for 11dmg
- Cyscokt misses with pulsecaster shortly

#### Round 4
- Nevos-4 takes a guarded step and hits last akata with hammer (4dmg) killing it

### Development
Nisk quickly secures the bridge door as Gereon succumbs to the infection. Take 10 break:
- Nevos-4 spends Resolve point to recover stamina
- cyscokt casts *Detect Affliction* on Gereon
  - confirms he is diseased but cannot discern other details
- cyscokt uses medkit to *Treat Disease* granting +4 bonus to Gereon's next check
- Taraea investigates the area and finds the 3 cocoons
  - identifies them as noqual and worth 500cr each
  - this triggers her recall of how akata hibernate
- Nisk checks out controls and computer stations, gaining basic access to the systems
  - closes and secures all ship doors
  - restores ship lighting to normal levels
  - closes all air hatches and begins to repressurize the ship (3 min to complete)

#### Hacking the System
Team decides it is critical to hack into the secure files.
- Gereon aids Nisk and after an initial failure, they gain access and discover another firewall to ship Logs
- Gereon is too fatigued to effectily help, but Nisk gets in on third try!

#### Ships logs
The logs detail the discovery of the Drift Rock, the crew’s initial exploration of the asteroid’s surface and the strange “geodes” they found there. The captain then states that the crew was under attack from monsters that “hatched” from the geodes they brought back to the ship.
-  the description of the monsters matches the akatas that the PCs have already faced

The next entry is more hurried, and the sounds of combat are audible in the background.
>“There’s something else—it came from the rock!” the captain reports with more than a trace of panic in his voice. “We’re getting overwhelmed! I’m going to open the ship to vacuum—maybe that’ll slow them down!”

The log’s final entry was recorded in Engineering and shows the captain in his space suit.
>“Purging the air didn’t work. I’ve set the autopilot to continue on to Absalom Station, but we’re abandoning ship. We’ll fall back to the rock and try to regroup there. Acreon out.”

That was the final entry

#### Path Ahead
- cyscokt is insistent that Gereon is in no condition to fight
  - nevos-4 has idea that he can remain on bridge as rest of team clears the ship, controlling door access

Take the starboard corridor first
- both crew quarters empty  

## Crew Storage
Nevos-4 was positioned in front of the doorway when he instructed Gereon to open it. The laser trap fired and struck it full in the chest (15 dmg). Nevos-4 uses recovery point and short rest while others search the room.
1. Nisk finds another noqual cocoon, 1 bulk 500cr value
2. ulrikka duster fusion seal (5th)
3. mk1b healing serums (2)
4. medpatches (3)
