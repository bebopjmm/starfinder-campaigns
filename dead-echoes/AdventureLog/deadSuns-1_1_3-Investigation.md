# Dead Suns 1.1: Absalom Gang War, Ch 3

## Further Investigations

It was early afternoon before everyone was moving the next day, and the hangovers were rather brutal. A greasy breakfast at a nearby diner helped ease the worst of it. The team universally agreed that the first priority for the day was making arrangements at the Moons of Sleep to eliminate the need to spend another night in a sleep pod. During 'breakfast' Gereon received a message from his corporate contact, and a meeting was arranged at Tattle Tails for that night. Taraea was not amused,

>"Honestly Gereon, is that the only establishment on Absalom Station that you know?"

With a wry grin, Gereon replied,

>"This is how business gets done, and believe it or not Tattle Tails is one of the few places I trust for sensitive discussions."

Changing the subject,
3. Nisk has underworld connections that could shed some more light on Downside Kings and Level-21.

As they departed the diner, Gereon received message from his father. After reading the message, he stowed his comms device and informed the others,

>"Well that didn't take long. The news reports have made my involvement in the Dock 94 incident public, including our meeting a Starfinder representative. My father has officially cut me off."


### Moons of Sleep

The team walks to the Moons of Sleep, which also helps work the self-inflicted toxins out of their systems. The Starfinder discount is on weekly rates: 16cr for an efficiency, and 50cr for a small two-bed suite.

- everyone ops for an efficiency room, except for Gereon who chooses a suite.

After a much needed freshening up, they regroup. Nisk brought up the a potential avenue for getting information on the street gangs involved in the Dock 94 attack from a contact she had in Little Akiton. There was time enough before meeting with Gereon's contact.



### A Visit to Little Akiton

The team tracks down Bezilt, a ysoki dock foreman. He reluctantly shares some information on the Downside Kings:

- Turnover among the Downside Kings’ leadership is high, but the gang’s current boss is a barbarous human woman named Ferani Nadaz.
- Astral Extractions recruited the Downside Kings to threaten the Hardscrabble Collective and pressure the miners into handing over the Acreon and the Drift Rock to the company without dispute.

He suggests that if the team really wants to know more about stuff like this, that they shoud go visit Diamond of Diamond Defense and Surplus down in the Spire.

### The Corporate Contact

Gereon is able to squeeze some critical information from his corporate contact, but the meal tab seemed excessive to most of the team (115cr):

- Following the arrival of the Acreon, Astral Extractions secretly hired a violent Absalom Station street gang called the Downside Kings to coerce the Hardscrabble Collective into abandoning its claims on the Acreon and the Drift Rock.

### Diamond Defense and Surplus

They find the shop in the Spire and are greeted by Diamond. She listens to their story and thinks a bit. She confirms that has useful information for the team and proposes a trade.

- Pest Control Mission: a group of goblins have encroached on an area she uses for business. Deal with them.


### Goblins in Botscrap

The team follows the directions to the Botscrap location and arrive without incident. Nevos-4 and Redacted scout the area and determine good locations to hunker down and wait. In the dim light it is difficult to see well, and the team notices the approaching two scouts at the same time the scouts notice them:

#### Round 1
- Nevos-4 misses
- Gereon gets in a great shot that badly wounds G-1
- Cyscokt holds position
- goblin scavengers scurry around
- Redacted misses both trick attack and shot
- G-1 moves to total cover
- G-2 moves to cover and readies shot against anyone coming into view north
- Taraea activates solar armor and graviton attunement (1) then moves around
	- G2 gets critical hit on Taraea

#### Round 2

- G-1 is fleeing
- G-2 fires at Taraea and hits again for 3 dmg
- Taraea take burning dmg (3), stay on graviton attunement (2), falls prone to smother flames, but to no avail

#### Round 3
- Nevos-4 moves to cover and fires at G-2, killing it
- Gereon moves south to cover, but it takes a full action to get there
- Cyscokt aids Taraea in dousing the flames
- G-4 fires at Cyscokt, hitting for 3 dmg
- G-5 fires at Gereon, hitting for 3 dmg
- Redacted moxies up, heads south and drops prone before killing G-4
- G-1 escapes
- Taraea takes burning dmg (3), stays on graviton attunement (3), and successfully smothers the flames

#### Round 4
- Nevos-4 moves west and readies to shoot if G-5 flees west
- Gereon moves to cover south and issues a "Get'em" against G-5
- Cyscokt casts mystic cure on Taraea (6HP) restoring all lost HP
- G-5 runs away west
	- Nevos-4 hits it for 5 dmg
- Redacted gives chase, full move
- Taraea dashes south

#### Round 5
- Nevos-4 dashes south
- Gereon moves east and fire at the fleeing G-5, killing it

#### Development
- 10 min rest has everyone at full strength
- Four sets of goblin ears are collected
- Team returns to Diamond Defense and Surplus
	- Diamond impressed with results, pays the 100cr bounty on the ears
	- Diamond tells them that if they want to talk to Jabaxa, then go to Mama Fats on Level-21 and request *Borelian Felgercarb Nuggets*
- Head back to the Ring area for celebratory drinks (50cr from party fund) and a good night's sleep

## Mama Fats

Everyone catches up on sleep and its almost noon before they have gathered to go check out Mama Fats. They reach Level-21 without incident. The area is the crowded, run-down lower half of Absalom Station. The surrounding neighborhood is low-end, but not quite a slum.
- Redacted recognizes and points out the graffiti on the walls as gang tags marking this as territory of the Level 21 Crew.

The bodega is clean, and a female halfling greets them. The team orders some lunch (15gp from party fund)
- Gereon sweet talks her from indifferent to friendly
- After lunch, Redacted requests the *Borelian Felgercarb Nuggets* to go. Mama Fats becomes suspicious, but then tells the team to come back tomorrow at 3 pm.

Team has downtime for the rest of the day

### Meeting Jabaxa

The team shows back up a Mama Fats at the appointed time.  They are escorted to a room in the back of the bodega, where the gang’s leader, Jabaxa, waits for them along with two of his gang members. Gereon and Redacted greet him politely and the ysoki invites them to have a seat. He then pours out a shot of bathtub moonshine for each of them as a gesture of hospitality before asking them their business.
- Redacted provides a brief summary of their investigation
- Jabaxa  flatly denies that his crew killed Duravor Kreel (they don’t even know who he was) and blames the murder on the Downside Kings. He claims that it was the Kings who started the shootout in Docking Bay 94, as well; his crew was there only to oppose them.

Gereon and Taraea succeed at diplomatically improving his attitude (eventually to helpful)
- another round of drinks and swapping some stories

Jabaxa tells the team about the nightclub, Fusion Queen, that the Downside Kings use as a front for their illegal activities.
- His gang can't be directly involved or a full-blown gangwar could be incited, which would put the citizens of Level-21 in danger.

## The Fusion Queen

Redacted convinces the team that they should at least check out the club before engaging in any kind of assault. They swing by the club and Redacted quickly recognizes the club’s logo, a stylized crown, as a variant of the Downside Kings’ symbol. As they approach the bouncer's immediately draw their laser pistols and inform them of the no weapons policy.
- Gereon was able to calm them down with a story that the team had just arrived on station from completing a mission and was looking for a place to unwind. They would drop off their gear and return later.

Heading back to the Moons of sleep, the team decided to follow through on the story an return to the club that evening without weapons.
- passing security check, they bouncers let them in
- they learn the basic layout of the club and take special note of the 'staff only' double doors.
  - Redacted verifies the door is locked using a keycard that all staff have
- the team has a few drinks (15cr) and dances. Gereon mildly questions the waitress and Redacted the bartender about the Downside Kings, but there is no indication that the staff knows anything about the gang.

After a few hours the team retires back to the Moons of Sleep.

### Formulating a Plan
Its obvious to everyone that they will need to get access to that staff area, but the crowd and staff are all civilians.
- Nevos-4 strongly thinks some additional gear would be helpful, and Diamond probably has everything they could need
- Redacted thinks she could swipe the keycard off a staff person with a proper distraction, but the team needs weapons inside the club
- Cyscokt cautions against unnecessary violence and bloodshed
- Taraea agrees that the team must avoid civilian injury

**Questions**:
1. How to deal with front door bouncers (obviously gang-members)?
  - flash grenades and daze spells to soften them up
2. How to get into the staff-only area?
  - swiping a keycard from waitress seems achievable
3. How to get weapons into the club?
  - Redacted can try to stash a gun or two in cheek pouches, but that is risky

#### The Plan
1. Redacted and Gereon will enter club early and with task of securing a keycard from one of the staff.
  - recon the backroom
2. Once they have a keycard, the other three will take out the front door bouncers.
  - flash grenade and daze spells to hinder them until taken out
3. Move fast to staff backroom and find Ferani

### Shopping
Nevos-4 recommends getting some additional gear, primarily grenades and healing serums. Diamonds Defense and Surplus has everything they need:
- Nevos-4 buys a flash grenade and 2 MK1b healing serums
- Cyscokt buys a needler pistol and 2 MK1b healing serums loaded into darts
- Redacted has a called fusion placed on her pistol and buy 1 MK1b healing serum
- Gereon buys a flash grenade and 1 MK1b healing serum
- Taraea buys 2 MK1b healing serums

### Execution
Redacted leaves her pistol with Taraea and with Gereon's aid disguises the flash grenade before placing it in a cheek pouch. She easily keeps it unnoticed from the front door bouncer that searches her. Once inside, Gereon picks out his mark, the waitress he flirted with last time. As he distracts her with an odd drink order, Redacted successfully swipes her keycard.

The two then ease over to the staff room doors. Gereon steps in sees the three goons playing cards. They immediately challenge him, and he gives a story about the waitress claiming to meet him back here, and that he's obviously the butt of her joke. They buy to story and chuckle, but then tell him to scram and don't come back in here or he'll find more trouble than a lying bar wench.

Gereon and Redacted relay their situation and findings over the personal comms. Its time to fully execute the strike. Redacted gives Gereon the flash grenade. The three outside approach, weapons at the ready. The bouncers spot them and draw weapons, issuing a challenge.

	- Nevos-4 discovers storage door is locked, but Redacted tosses him the keycard, which opens it
	- Nevos-4 and Taraea loot to storage room
- Redacted easily hacks the infoPad
	- numerous files and communication records that detail Downside Kings' criminal activity
	- which gives her access to club security camera system, and she is able to erase all footage of the past half hour.

There isn't time to fully investigate the files and messages here, so the team heads out. With the smoke dissipated, the frightened patrons are fleeing, and the team manages to slip into the crowd. Sirens of approaching security forces can be heard approaching. The team makes their escape.
- Cyscokt performs *Healing Touch* on Gereon and casts *Mystic Cure* on Taraea

## Conclusion

With time to analyze Ferani's infoPad, Redacted finds all kinds of incriminating information. Of primary interest is communications proving that an employee of Astral Extractions hired the Downside Kings to eliminate Duravor Kreel both as a message to the Hardscrabble Collective that the corporation means business and to keep the Starfinder Society from getting too curious about the Acreon and the Drift Rock.

1. clean up and rest
	- everyone is back at full health and resolve

### Sharing Results

Next day the team first shares their results with Chiskisk. They commend the PCs for their successful investigation and thanks them for risking their lives to find justice for Duravor.
- asks the PCs to keep the details of the Fusion Queen raid to themselves but isn’t one to judge, believing that one reaps what one sows
- asks for any evidence the PCs might have found regarding the Downside Kings’ involvement in Kreel’s murder to turn over to station officials
	- Redacted will keep a copy of all the materials as an insurance policy
- recommends that the PCs leave any ramifications of Astral Extractions’ possible criminal enterprises to Absalom Station’s legal system; the company has a powerful presence on the station, and Chiskisk doesn’t want the PCs or the Starfinder Society to risk a battle that neither has much chance of winning

Chiskisk is also pleased to officially welcome the team members into the ranks of the Starfinder Society, and states that they are looking forward to the discoveries the team will make and the knowledge that they will share with the Society in the future.
- official induction ceremony will be scheduled in a few days
- no jobs for them at this time, but is interested and somewhat troubled by the revelation that Astral Extractions is attempting to keep the Starfinders away from the Acreon and the Drift Rock. As a result, Chiskisk asks the PCs to keep their senses aware for any further news about the contentious ship and its mysterious cargo that might be of interest to the Society.

The team also contacts Jabaxa, who congratulates them on a well executed assault. He lets them know that they have earned the appreciation of the Level-21 crew and can call in a favor.
