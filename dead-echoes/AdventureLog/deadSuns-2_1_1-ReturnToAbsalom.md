### Development

Stewards starships come over the comms offering support. The Iron Rictus explodes. Steward starships offer escort to Absalom Station.

## Arrival in Absalom

The group is much surprised at the welcome reception upon their return.
- station security representative informs them that the possessions left aboard the Hippocampus are available for retrieval
  - explains that the shuttle was returned to Absalom Station as part of quarantine procedures
- everything is still aboard the shuttle **except** the cargo container containing Commander Eskolar
  - when asked about the cargo container, the security representative checks a manifest and shares that the Eoxian embassy took possession of the container shortly after the shuttle returned

The team gathers all their gear and valuables and secures transportation to the Moons of Sleep. As they were dropping off gear, Ambassador Nor contacted them eager to meet at their earliest opportunity.

## Meeting Ambassador Nor

The ambassador was very pleased with the team and congratulated them heartily on a job very well done.
- transferred 600cr into each team member's account
- requested a first hand report
  - Taraea summarized their key findings and conclusions
  - 'Who should get the Acreon'
    - team believes the ship belongs to the Hardscrabble Collective, but all the collected prospecting data belongs to Astral Extractions
  - 'Who should get possession of the Drift Rock'
    - after some thought, the team concludes that neither party should be awarded possession of the Drift Rock
    - due to nature of discoveries it should remain in quarantine under Starfinder Society purview, with results of further research and investigations shared with Pact World members

Discussion then turned to the 'special package' that the team recovered.
- transferred 500cr into each team member's account
- he brushed aside the team's initial questions as an internal Eoxian matter
- when pressed he reassured the team that securing a renegade officer was an act of interplanetary safety, not some indication that he is in league with the Corpse Fleet.

He turned the discussion next to the hit reality show. This was an idea of Zo! when Nor shared some of the early footage with him.

Back to more serious matters, he offers assistance in deciphering the complex alien computer code that the PCs found in the Drift Rock's ancient control room.
- team agrees to take the offer under advisement

Ambassador Nor wishes the team the best of luck with their endeavors.

## Reporting in at Starfinder Society

Shortly after departing the Eoxian embassy, the team was contacted by Chiskisk, who wanted a debrief of the mission.
- Off to the Lorespire complex

He congratulated them on a very successful mission and shared that First Seeker Luwazi Elsebo was quite pleased at the publicity (and funds) that the reality tv show had brought to the Starfinder Society.

Taraea shares with Chiskisk the nature of the 'special package' that got delivered to Ambassaor Nor from the Acreon.
- Chiskisk expressed a mix of curiousity and unease. IF this is truly a renegade officer from the Corpse Fleet, then Commander Escolar could prove a valuable asset. They thank the team for the information and assure them that the society will be keeping tabs on the situation.

Chiskisk then turns discussion to the alien devices and language found on the Drift Rock.
- search of database yields texts by Halkueem Zan
- answers a lot of questions about Zan and Qabarat University

> "This is a strong lead. Because you have so far been at the forefront of this investigation, we believe it would only be proper for you to visit the university and learn more. We know that you have just returned, but thanks to the popularity of the broadcast of your Drift Rock exploration, it's only a matter of time before someone else beats the Society to the prize. The Sunrise Maiden will need a couple days in dock for much overdue maintenance. We would recommend heading to Castrovel as soon as possible."

The team accepts the assignment.

## Downtime

With only a couple of days to prepare, the team gets busy outfitting for the new assignment, dogged by the press and fans at pretty much every step.
- Gereon and Nisk arrange the sale of exotic art and trade goods that they brought back
- Taraea and Cyscokt arrange for personal effects of crew recovered to be returned to Hardscabble Collective

### Diamond

Sell the noqual cocoons and security robot remains to Diamond along with some surplus gear. Also spend a lot of credits upgrading armor and gear.

## Departure

The maintenance actually took three days, but then the team loaded up all their gear and headed for Castrovel.
