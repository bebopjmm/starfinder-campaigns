# Dead Suns 1.2: Ghost Ship, Ch 3

## Boarding

No light initially, rely totally on dim light of ship emergency lights.

*Marching Order*
1. Nevos-4 , Nisk
2. Gereon, Taraea
3. Cyscokt

As soon as the airlock door opened into the ship, flickering emergency lights did little to dispel the darkness inside the derelict ship, and the sense of abandonment was only heightened by the apparent lack of any movement or life inside its airless corridors. Artificial gravity still functioned, however, so there was likely still power to run essential systems and possibly restore life support and atmosphere to the ship. Unfortunately, there were still no obvious clues as to the fate of the Acreon’s vanished crew.

Nevos-4 and Nisk spotted a small body in a space suit sprawled on the floor in the middle of a junction in the hallway.. Cautiously the team approached, Nisk turning on her flashlight so that Cyscokt could examine the remains. As soon as Cyscokt reached the body, the shirren stiffened and warned over the comms,
>"Something's coming down the hall!"

### Corridor Akata Encounter
Nisk and Cyscokt are not surprised

#### Surprise round
- akata closes on cyscokt and Nisk
- nisk tumbled out of range of the akata, drawing her semi-auto pistol
- cyscokt took a guarded step back

#### Round 1
- akata closes on nevos-4 and cyscokt, biting nevos-4 for 6dmg
  - nevos-4 resists disease
- nisk relocates, failing trick attack but hits akata for 5dmg
- gereon issues *Get'em* on akata and attempts laser pistol shot (nevos-4 soft cover), but just missiles
- taraea activates her solar armor and photon attunes(1) and stabs at akata with pike, missing
- nevos-4 grabs his assault hammer and hits 3dmg
- cyscokt studies the creature while taking guarded step back
  - shares that the creature is an akata, a space predator that is susceptible to salt water

#### Round 2
- akata presses attack on nevos-4, but misses
- nisk fails trick attack and misses akata
- gereon won't risk the shot, but issues *Get'em*
- taraea steps up and stabs akata with pike, 6dmg , photon attunement(2)
- nevos-4 swings again with hammer, but misses
- cyscokt unleashes shooting stars to kill akata, 8dmg

#### Development
- studying the dead akata, Taraea recalls that these creatures are resistant to fire damage, so laser pistols probably won't be much use.
- cyscokt resumes inspection of the corpse and identifies that it is a space goblin
  - Nisk verifies that no space goblins were part of the Acreon crew manifest

So far all the viewable ship doors are locked in the open position, including the bridge.

## Advance to bridge
Decide to stick to the plan an make directly for the bridge, but everyone extra alert.
- Gereon has his flashlight on as he an Taraea guard the rear as they approach the bridge.
- no one is surprised that more of the akatas are on the bridge

### Bridge Akata Encounter

#### Round 1
- Nevos-4 calls out north and moves in and fires at akata-1, hitting for 5dmg
- Gereon moves to bridge door and shines light on akata-1, issues *Get'em*
- akata 1&2 converge on Nevos-4 both biting for total of 12dmg
  - no infection
- akata-3 moves to doorway and bites Gereon for 4dmg
  - Gereon infected
- Nisk tumbles back drawing his pistol
- Taraea activates her stellar armor, shifts to photon attunement and stellar rushes akata-3
- cyscokt unleashes 3 shooting stars at akata-3 for 11dmg

#### Round 2
- Nevos-4 goes into total defense mode (22 KAC)
- Gereon takes a guarded step back and issues *Get'em* on akata-3
- akata 1&2 press their attack, but Nevos-4 fends them off
- akata-3 bites at Taraea but misses
- Nisk trick attack shot kills akata-3
- Taraea moves in to assist Nevos-4, photon attunement(2), flanking akata-2 and hitting with pike (7dmg)
- cyscokt moved into the Bridge

#### Round 3
- Nevos-4 maintained total defense mode, taunting the akatas
- Gereon moved into bridge and issued *Get'em* on akata-2
- akata-1 failed to bite Nevos-4
- akata-2 moved to bite Taraea (AoO) for 5dmg
  - AoO hit with pike for 5dmg
  - no infection
- Nisk trick attack shot kills akata-2
- Taraea hits akata-1 with pike for 11dmg
- Cyscokt misses with pulsecaster shortly

#### Round 4
- Nevos-4 takes a guarded step and hits last akata with hammer (4dmg) killing it

### Development
Nisk quickly secures the bridge door as Gereon succumbs to the infection. Take 10 break:
- Nevos-4 spends Resolve point to recover stamina
- cyscokt casts *Detect Affliction* on Gereon
  - confirms he is diseased but cannot discern other details
- Taraea investigates the area and finds the 3 cocoons
  - identifies them as noqual and worth 500cr each
  - this triggers her recall of how akata hibernate
- Nisk checks out controls and computer stations, gaining basic access to the systems
  - closes and secures all ship doors
  - restores ship lighting to normal levels
  - closes all air hatches and begins to repressurize the ship (3 min to complete)

#### Hacking the System
Team decides it is critical to hack into the secure files.
- Gereon aids Nisk and after an initial failure, they gain access and discover another firewall to ship Logs
- Gereon is too fatigued to effectily help, but Nisk gets in on third try!

#### Ships logs
The logs detail the discovery of the Drift Rock, the crew’s initial exploration of the asteroid’s surface and the strange “geodes” they found there. The captain then states that the crew was under attack from monsters that “hatched” from the geodes they brought back to the ship.
-  the description of the monsters matches the akatas that the PCs have already faced

The next entry is more hurried, and the sounds of combat are audible in the background.
>“There’s something else—it came from the rock!” the captain reports with more than a trace of panic in his voice. “We’re getting overwhelmed! I’m going to open the ship to vacuum—maybe that’ll slow them down!”

The log’s final entry was recorded in Engineering and shows the captain in his space suit.
>“Purging the air didn’t work. I’ve set the autopilot to continue on to Absalom Station, but we’re abandoning ship. We’ll fall back to the rock and try to regroup there. Acreon out.”

That was the final entry

#### Path Ahead
- cyscokt is insistent that Gereon is in no condition to fight
  - nevos-4 has idea that he can remain on bridge as rest of team clears the ship, controlling door access

Take the starboard corridor first
- both crew quarters empty  

## Crew Storage
Nevos-4 was positioned in front of the doorway when he instructed Gereon to open it. The laser trap fired and struck it full in the chest (15 dmg). Nevos-4 uses recovery point and short rest while others search the room.
1. Nisk finds another noqual cocoon, 1 bulk 500cr value
2. ulrikka duster fusion seal (5th)
3. mk1b healing serums (2)
4. medpatches (3)

## Crew quarters
The team moved on to checking the starboard side crew quarters, but they are both empty with nothing of interest beyond a few personal possessions. Advancing to the port crew quarters, they discover one of the doors jammed. With Nevos-4's aid, Taraea breaks open the door on her second attempt.

### Goblin Encounter

#### Round 1
- Nisk maneuvers into the room and shoots Goblin-1 with laser pistol (3dmg)
- Taraea steps into the room, photon attunement, and beheads Goblin-2 with her pike (9dmg)
- Nevos-4 closes but misses Goblin-1
- Goblin-1 (Nolkiek) drops weapon and surrenders

#### Development
- interrogation of the goblin revealed that he and his companions only recently arrived on the Acreon, and very quickly encountered the 'blue devil dogs'
  - Nisk is inclined to space the goblin, but Cyscokt won't hear of it (convinced of story)
  - Cyscokt also treats the goblins wounds with medkit (1hp)
- collect the real weapons, allowing the goblin to keep its dogslicer and junklaser
  - Nisk also finds the keycard and credstick
- decide to lock Nolkiek in the quarters while the team finishes securing the ship
  - Taraea and Gereon convince the goblin that he will be kept safe

## Starboard Cargo hold
With Nolkiek secured in the crew quarters, the team proceeded to the starboard cargo hold. Nevos-4 entered cautiously after Gereon opened the door and immediately spotted an akata on the far side of the hold.

### Akata Encounter

#### Round 1
- Nisk moves into the cargo hold and realizes there are actually TWO akatas! She shoots akata-1 for 4dmg
- the akatas converge on Nisk, and one bites for 6dmg
  - Nisk resists disease
- Taraea moves into cargo hold, shifts to photon attunement and strikes at akata-1 with pike but misses
- Cyscokt cast daze on akata-2  but it was unaffected
- Nevos-4 shoots autocannon at akata-1 and then moves to engage with hammer

#### Round 2
- Nisk attempted to tumble away from the akatas but failed, one bites for 3dmg. Activates holo images (2)
  - Nisk failed save and is infected with void death
- akata-2 bites at Nisk but misses
- akata-2 bites at Nevos-4 but misses
- Taraea activates solar armor and strikes at akata-1 with pike missing again
- Cyscokt attempts daze again on akata-2 but to no avail
- Nevos-4 strikes at akata-1 with hammer but misses

#### Round 3
- Nisk takes a guarded step and continues Total defense
- akata-1 turns its attention to Nisk, but misses
- akata-2 engages and bites Nevos-4 (8dmg)
  - Nevos-4 resists disease
- Taraea kills akata-1 with pike (6dmg)
- Cyscokt attempts to daze akata-2, but it continues to resist
- Nevos-4 misses akata-2 with hammer

#### Round 4
- Nisk takes a guarded step and shoots at akata-2 for critical hit (11dmg)
- that draws akata-1 attention, it closes on Nisk, but misses
- Taraea nicks akata-1 with pike (4dmg)
- Cyscokt successfully dazed akata-1
- Nevos-4 flanked akata-2 and killed it with hammer (7dmg)

### Development
Exploration of the cargo hold yields
- 2 noqual cocoon scraps (2 bulk, 1000cr)
- cyscokt finds flame pistol with 8 petrol

Team falls back to the bridge to regroup.
- cyscokt casts *Lesser Remove Condition* to remove the *sickened* condition from Nisk
- team decision to bunk down for the night and finish clearing ship tomorrow
  - Nisk and Gereon will rest in one of the crew quarters, while the rest of the team stays on bridge.
- Nevos-4 and Taraea transfer the rest of their gear and supplies from the Hippocampus to the bridge while Cyscokt preps meal
  - galley still has food, so they don't have to tap into their provisions
  - they feed Nolkiek as well
- Uneventful night

Next day Nisk and Gereon attempt to fight off void Death
- cyscokt uses medkit to *Treat Disease* granting +4 bonus to Nisk's next check, and she succeeds
  - stays in Weakened state (1 of 2 needed saves)
- cyscokt uses medkit to *Treat Disease* granting +4 bonus to Gereon's next check, but he fails
  - degrades to Impaired state (*sickened*, *fatigued*, *exhausted*)
- cyscokt casts *Lesser Remove Condition* to remove the *sickened* condition from Nisk

Gereon is still healthy enough to operate doors from bridge, so the team gears up and continues to port cargo hold.

## Port Cargo Hold
Inspecting the cargo hold the team quickly discovers the large 8ft square shipping container addressed to the Eoxian Embassy. They transmit video to Gereon of their find.
- Nisk is strongly inclined to open an inspect the container
- Cyscokt believes that opening the container would violate the spirit if not explicitly the terms of the agreement that was made with Ambassador Nor
- Nevos-4 is concerned that violating Ambassador's trust would result in a powerful enemy
- Gereon raises the point that learning the contents would put the team in a stronger position
- Taraea is suspicious, but also raises the point that the most pressing concern is securing the ship

The team defers dealing with the container until ship is clear. Last area is engineering.

## Engineering
Gereon opens both doors, and Taraea enters from south while Nevos-4 enters from north. Both spot akatas and alert the others.

### Akata Encounter
#### Round 1
- Nisk enters room, trick attacking akata-2 with pistol for critical hit (13dmg)
- akata-2 closes to engage Taraea, triggering AoO and she skewers it with her pike
- akata-1 engages Nevos-4 but he deflects its bite attack
- Nevos-4 gets solid hit on akata-1 with hammer (7dmg)
- Cyscokt enters room and fails to affect akata-1 with *Daze* spell
- Taraea shifts to photon attunement, closes on akata-1 and nicks it (3dmg)

#### Round 2
- Nisk moves up but fails trick attack and misses akata-1
- akata-1 misses bite against Nevos-4
- Nevos-4 hits again (4dmg)
- Cysokt succesfully *dazes* akata-1
- Taraea moves to flanking position on akata-1 and kills it (7dmg)

### Development

Search the room and find
- 2 more noqual cocoons (2 bulk, 1000cr)
- 300 UPBs
- tactical arc emitter (12 charges)

The ship is now fully secured. After Nevos-4 and Taraea jetison all the akata corspes out an airlock, everyone reconvenes on the bridge, including the goblin, Nolkiek.

## Next Steps
With the ship secured, the party now focuses on
1. treating the void death
2. dealing with the Eoxian container
3. exploring the Drift Rock

The container is at the forefront of Nisk's mind, and Gereon is very curious as well. Taraea is firm that the key priority is health of team.
- Cysokt wants Gereon on full bedrest.
- Nevos-4 recommends contacting Absalom Station over the Acreon's comms for medical evac
  - Nisk gets station control and relays the situation
  - request is denied, quarantine effect does not allow affected to be brought to station

Downtime to next day
- Taraea reviews the ship logs
- Nisk (with Nolkiek underfoot) spends time in engineering

## Day 3 Aboard

Nisk and Gereon attempt to fight off void Death
- cyscokt uses medkit to *Treat Disease* granting +8 bonus (crit success) to Gereon's next check, and he just barely succeeds
  - stays in Impaired state (1 of 2 needed saves)
- cyscokt uses medkit to *Treat Disease* granting +4 bonus to Nisk's next check, and she succeeds
  - healthy again
- cyscokt casts *Lesser Remove Condition* to remove the *sickened* condition from Gereon

### The Container

The team gathered in the port cargo hold to make decisions regarding Ambassador Nor's 'package.' Final decision is to at least inspect the contents before bringing it back.

- Nisk gets the container open, but not without leaving evidence of tampering

Commander Eskolar is revealed!
- after a moment's disorientation she demands to know what is going on as it does not appear that she has been delivered to the Eoxian embassy.
  - Taraea answers that she is still on the Acreon, that the team is investigating events. Inquires who she is.
  - Eskolar responds with her name only, Hebiza Eskolar
- Cyscokt and Nisk both recognize her uniform as that of a commander of the Corpse Fleet, and Cyscokt confronts her with this information
  - Eskolar ignores the question, but claims that she's traveling to Absalom Station to serve as a military attaché assigned to the Eoxian diplomatic mission. What is the nature of the event being investigated, and why is the ship not at Absalom station?
  -
- Nevos-4 questions the odd traveling arrangement for a military attaché
  - Eskolar responds her mission is sensitive in nature
  - Gereon knows that there is technically no specific laws prohibiting the shipping of *willing* sentient species as cargo, but it's clear that Ambassador Nor was intending her arrival to be covert.
- At the mention of Ambassador Nor, she inquires if Nor sent them


Eventually the team agrees to return her to the capsule with the promise to honor their arrangement with Ambassador Nor. She presses both the urgency as well as sensitivity of her mission.
- no one is particularly satisfied with the situation
