# Dead Suns 1.2: Ghost Ship, Ch 2

## The Hippocampus

As promised, Gevalarsk Nor has procured a ship for the PCs—the shuttle Hippocampus, which is waiting in a private docking bay. The Hippocampus is one of numerous shuttles that regularly ferry passengers and cargo between Absalom Station and visiting ships that either are too big to dock directly with the station or prefer to remain among the ships of the Armada. Originally a Ringworks Wanderer model, the Hippocampus has been heavily modified for station security use, and Nor has further modified it for the PCs’ expedition with upgraded armor, defenses, shields, power core, and sensors, and the addition of a turret-mounted coilgun.

The Hippocampus’s thrusters take only a couple of minutes to warm up, Absalom Traffic Control gives clearance for takeoff, and the PCs launch into space. No Piloting check is needed; the PCs’ destination is not far from Absalom Station and the course has been preprogrammed into the shuttle’s computer. It takes the PCs only 2 hours to reach the quarantine zone around the Acreon and the Drift Rock. Along the way, they can get a good view of the exterior of Absalom Station, as well as the so-called Armada, the endlessly moving fleet of independent ships that surrounds the gigantic space platform.
