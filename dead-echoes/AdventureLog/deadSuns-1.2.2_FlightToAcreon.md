# Dead Suns 1.2: Ghost Ship, Ch 2

## The Hippocampus

As promised, Gevalarsk Nor has procured a ship for the PCs—the shuttle Hippocampus, which is waiting in a private docking bay. The Hippocampus is one of numerous shuttles that regularly ferry passengers and cargo between Absalom Station and visiting ships that either are too big to dock directly with the station or prefer to remain among the ships of the Armada. Originally a Ringworks Wanderer model, the Hippocampus has been heavily modified for station security use, and Nor has further modified it for the PCs’ expedition with upgraded armor, defenses, shields, power core, and sensors, and the addition of a turret-mounted coilgun.

Once they boarded the ship, they discovered one other surprise. A small observer robot welcomed everyone aboard and informed them that it would be accompanying the team and record their expedition. The ambassador wanted an objective record that he could provide to both sides as a foundation for his mediation efforts.

*Team Reactions to the Ship and the Observer*

Ship Assignments:

- Taraea: Captain
- Nevos-4: Piloting
- Gereon: Science officer
- Nisk: engineering
- Cyscokt: Gunner

The Hippocampus’s thrusters take only a couple of minutes to warm up, Absalom Traffic Control gives clearance for takeoff, and the PCs launch into space. No Piloting check is needed; the PCs’ destination is not far from Absalom Station and the course has been preprogrammed into the shuttle’s computer. It takes the PCs only 2 hours to reach the quarantine zone around the Acreon and the Drift Rock. Along the way, they can get a good view of the exterior of Absalom Station, as well as the so-called Armada, the endlessly moving fleet of independent ships that surrounds the gigantic space platform.

## Interceptor attack!

Shortly after passing through the last fringes of the Armada, the Hippocampus’s sensors picked up a small ship that had detached itself from the bulk of the Armada and turned toward the shuttle on an intercept course. Strangely, however, the ship’s transponder did not seem to be working—it wasn't broadcasting any identification codes, and the ship did not respond to any hails. An alarm suddenly sounded in the cockpit of the Hippocampus—the mystery ship was armed, and targeting it's weapons on the shuttle! Battle stations!!

### Round 1

#### engineering
- Nisk diverted aux power to science equipment (+2 to Science Officer)

#### helm
- Taraea encouraged Nevos-4 (using one bonus) (+2 to Piloting)
- Nevos-4 wins the initiative
- Stiletto closes
- Nevos-4 evades as he moves into a firing position
- Gereon scans and determines basic info, defenses, and weapons

#### gunnery
- stiletto does not have a firing solution
- cyscokt crits with coilgun! (10 dmg -> 2 critical damage rolls)
  1. power core
  2. weapons array

### Round 2

#### engineering
- Nisk diverted aux power to engines (+2 speed)

#### helm
- Taraea encourages Nevos-4 again (using one bonus) (+2 to Piloting)
- Nevos-4 wins the initiative again
- stiletto attempts to get behind, but Nevos-4 executes back-off forcing it in front
- Gereon targets the stiletto's weapon systems

#### gunnery
- again the stiletto is denied a firing solution
- Cyscokt misses shot with coilgun

### Round 2

#### engineering
- Nisk diverts aux power to weapons (1 treated as 2 on dmg)

#### helm
- Gereon loses the targeting focus on weapon systems
- Nevos-4 wins the initiative again
- stiletto performs a flip and burn, but Nevos-4 positions outside of forward firing arc

#### gunnery
- again the stiletto is denied a firing solution
- Taraea encourages Cyscokt (+2 to attack)
- Cyscokt hits with coilgun (10 dmg -> 1 critical damage)
  1. emp cannon is now malfunctioning

### Round 3

#### Engineering
- Nisk diverts aux power to weapons

#### helm
- Gereon regains the targeting on weapons systems (19-20 crit range)
- Nevos-4 wins the initiative yet again!
- stiletto successfully pulls off a fly-by attack
- Nevos-4 performs evasive maneuvers (+2 AC and TL)

#### gunnery
- stiletto gyrolaser hits for 2dmg to port shields
- Taraea encourages Cyscokt (+2 to attack)
- Cyscokt hits with coilgun (11 dmg -> 2 critical damage)
  1. emp cannon is wrecked
  2. sensors are glitching

### Round 4

### engineering
- Nisk diverts aux power to weapons

#### helm
- Gereon executes another scan
  - confirms forward and port shields down, and below 20% hull strength
- Nevos-4 win the initiative again!
- stiletto successfully pulls off another fly-by attack
- Nevos-4 performs evasive maneuvers (+2 AC and TL) and lines up on starboard

#### gunnery
- stiletto gyrolaser misses
- Taraea fails to encourage Cyscokt
- Cyscokt hits with coilgun (10 dmg -> 1 critical damage)
  - engines glitching

The enemy ship is disabled and veers off. Victory!
Now on to the Acreon.

### Development

## Arrival at the Acreon

The team continued their journey to the Acreon unhindered. The Acreon was an old prospecting and mining ship that had seen years of hard use in the asteroid fields and hard vacuum of the Pact Worlds and beyond. It was a boxy and ungainly ship, and its patched and repatched outer hull bore the scars of countless micrometeorite impacts and was faded from exposure to the radiation of space. The Acreon floated alone in space, far from Absalom Station, its only companion the misshapen asteroid called the Drift Rock, which was tethered behind the ship on long tow cables. The Acreon’s transponder broadcasted a repeating message that the ship was under quarantine by order of Absalom Station security, warning away any curious onlookers and would- be explorers.

Taraea ordered Gereon to scan the ship as Nevos-4 circled its perimeter.
- identified the ship as a Medium transport that can carry a full crew complement of six
  - The sensors are unable to get a good reading on any life signs that might be present on the ship
  - The ship’s aft airlock is open, exposing the interior of the ship to vacuum
  - The Acreon is armed, though none of its weapons are currently active, and its power core is outputting minimal energy—enough for life support, gravity, and basic ship functions, but little else.

Taraea also wants a scan of the Drift airlock, but Gereon reported that something seemed to be interfering with the sensors and no clear readings could be taken.

### Boarding plan

1. Which airlock?
2. Gear up
