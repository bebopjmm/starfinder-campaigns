# Dead Suns 1.1: Absalom Gang War, Ch 1

The disastrous Scoured Stars incident resulted in the disappearance of nearly 80% of the assets and agents of the Starfinder Society within an unreachable region of space.

**Cyscokt** was grew up in the Diaspora within a 3-member married shirren spacefaring family. Always a lover of space travel and fascinated with alien worlds, he dreamed of seeing more of the galaxy. With the full support of his family he became an acolyte of the Desnan church, traveling with a Desnan mystic. The Starfinder Society's recruitment drive caught Cyscokt's attention and appealed to his desire to travel, learn, and make a difference. With the approval of his teacher, he submitted an application, which attracted the interest of the Wayfinders faction. The shirren mystic received a recruitment offer with starship passage to Absalom Station to meet Duravor Kreel.

**Gereon d’Amboise** was born to wealth and privilege at Absalom Station as the oldest son of a very prominent corporate executive specializing at negotiating business deals. He was being groomed to eventually take over the business and had achieved great publicity and recognition. Gereon had become very disenchanted, however, with the corruption between corporations and governments. When the Starfinder Society's initiated the recruitment drive, Gereon saw an opportunity to make a difference for the good of all citizens rather than just an elite few, and he reached out to the Second-seekers faction through backchannels. They took immediate notice and had a recruitment offer covertly issued. Gereon's father found out about the offer and threatened to totally cut Gereon off if he pursued it. Undaunted, Gereon accepted the offer and its instructions for meeting with Starfinder representative, Duravor Kreel.

**Nevos-4** was 'born' at a foundry on Aballon, where it was immediately transitioned into military training. Upon certification as a soldier class android with piloting specialization, Nevo-4 decided against following the traditional path of military or corporate security service, instead choosing to become a freelance operative with the Starfinder Society. This choice allowed for greater independence to do the most good towards protecting the Pact Worlds and eliminate the illegal manufacture and slavery of androids. The Exo-Guardian faction took interest in Nevos-4's application, and it received a recruitment offer with starship passage to Absalom Station to meet Duravor Kreel.

**Nisk** grew up on Akiton, where she developed impressive engineering, computer, and infiltration skills. One thing readily apparent was that she desperately needed to get off that planet and the Starfinder Society recruitment drive provided the perfect opportunity for a fresh start. The Datafiles faction approved her application and arranged for her new identity to receive a recruitment offer with starship passage to Absalom Station to meet Duravor Kreel.

**Taraea** was born on Castrovel to a prosperous Lashunta family of artisans. As she entered her formative years of study, Taraea became engrossed with the solarian path. Although they didn't understand her fascination, her family supported her choice to apprentice at the Cosmonastery of the Empty Orbit on Absalom Station. They do, however, have expectations that her endeavors will at some point benefit Castrovel, and as a natural byproduct the family. Taraea graduated from her training as the Starfinder Society started their recruitment push. The organization appealed strongly to her desire to seek out and understand alien life. The Wayfinders faction took interest in her application, and Taraea received a recruitment offer with instructions to meet Starfinder representative, Duravor Kreel.

## Introductions

The appointment date had arrived. Gereon and Taraea currently lived at Absalom Station, while Nisk, Cyscokt, and Nevos-4 arrived by starship from their prior homes and boarded the shuttle Okimoro for transport to the station. As the shuttle Okimoro loaded its passengers Gereon and Taraea received the confirmation of meeting time and place, Dock 94 at 1030hrs, on their infoPads. Gereon applied a simple disguise to avoid unwanted attention prior to departing for the dock. Each of the recruits had been provided the name, picture, and short description of Durovar Kreel as well as each other.

The brightly lit docks of Absalom Station were abuzz with activity as travelers bustled by, preparing to board or disembarking from starships bound to or from any of dozens of worlds. Brash and swaggering starpilots, scurrying ysoki mechanics, and expectant colonists mingled with enigmatic kasatha mystics, hard-faced asteroid miners, imposing vesk mercenaries, and more, creating a microcosm of the abundance and variety of life in the Pact Worlds. New arrivals met friends, loved ones, or business contacts, and were whisked away into the humming activity of daily life on the vast space station. Beyond them, ground crews tended to the docked ships, and dockworkers in mechanized cargo lifters loaded and unloaded freight and baggage. A sharp tang of ozone hung in the air — a byproduct of electrical discharges from the docked ships — but underneath, the station’s atmosphere had a slightly used aroma. The docking bay’s deck plates thrummed beneath their feet as the recruits assembled, making brief greetings and introductions while looking for their designated Starfinder representative, Duravor Kreel.

Nisk was the first to notice the tall and lanky dwarf with a bristly, iron-gray beard and deep-set eyes. With his patched and stained coveralls, Duravor looked like just another dockerworker, but a badge with the Starfinder Society crest stood out on his chest. He was busy checking the infoPad in his hand, but as the group waved to gain his attention, Taraea noticed two groups of three toughs on the fringes of the docking bay furtively taking up defensive positions among stacks of cargo crates and machinery. Before she could warn the other of her concerns, two events happened. Duravor looked up and spotting the recruits waved and smiled warmly, and then the two groups of thugs opened fire on each other.

## Caught in the Crossfire

The air filled with laser blasts before any of the recruits could react. Bystanders screamed and began to flee in terror or dive for cover. Kreel froze, paralyzed with fear, and then, when a laser beam struck him in the neck, the dwarf fell to the deck and didn't move. Taking notice of Taraea, one of the thugs to the right of the recruits fired and struck her in the shoulder with his laser pistol. Infuriated, Taraea summoned her solar armor, the small mote that hovered near her head suddenly shining before enveloping the lashunta in a blue aura of stellar plasma, and then dashed to cover while drawing her longsword.

Recovering from their initial shock, the rest of the recruits sprung into action. Nisk dashed to cover, drawing her pistol and assessing the situation. Gereon recognized the thugs on the team's left side as Level-21 Crew gang members. Puzzled because this area was not their turf and the Level-21 Crew was not known for being particularly violent, he made a snap assessment that the other thugs must be worse. Plus they had already fired on his new acquaintances. Moving to cover, he shouted inspiration to his new teammates,
>"Those to right are the bigger threat. Get that thug that shot Taraea!"

Nevos-4 was more than willing to comply. Moving to cover, he shouldered his autocannon and returned fire, hitting the thug in the leg. Taraea dashed toward the thug, taking cover beside an abandoned vehicle. Shocked by the wanton violence and concerned for Durovar's condition, Cyscokt scurried towards the fallen dwarf. Nisk briefly watched the shirren with absolute astonishment before realizing she was still in the open, and then she darted for cover beside some nearby crates.

The gang members continued to trade laser fire. One of the thugs further ahead had caught on fire from a severe laser blast. Dropping to the ground and rolling, he successfully smothered out the flames. The Level-21 Crew got a couple of lucky hits on their enemies, killing one gang member and setting another on fire. The crew hadn't come out unscathed however, as one of their members who dashed across the dock to take cover behind a supply trailer was struck by a laser blast.

Gereon's harrasing pistol fire pinned the thug down and allowed Nevos-4 to line up a killing shot. With the immediate threat removed, Taraea dashed around to close in on the last gang member, who was busy smothering the flames. Seeing an opening, Nisk darted over to the Level-21 Crew gang member that had crossed the docks. Hand signaling a wish to parley, she asked,
>"Ayo who's troddin' amped de aggro"

In between shots, the gang member responded,
>"Docks no man's. Rumint da Downdside Kings goin' wet and gaffer say push ta cap. We beast'em yok"

Having put out the flames, the last Downside Kings thug realized that all of his comrades were dead and started to flee, but Taraea caught up with him and struck him down with her longsword. Cyscokt reached Duravor and confirmed his worst fear, the dwarf was already dead with a hole burned completely through his neck from a laser beam.

The engagement won, the Level-21 Crew gang members whooped a victory cry, "Ownage!" before taking off back to the west. Almost as soon as the final gangmember has been dispatched, the security alerts sound, indicating that the Absalom Security Forces would soon arrive. Gereon, Nevos-4, and Taraea confirmed the Downside Kings thugs were all dead, taking their credsticks and disengaging the batteries from their laser pistols. Nisk joined Cyscokt at Duravor's side. Spotting the dead dwarf's infoPad, she grabbed it and stashed it within a cheek pouch.

When the security forces arrived, two squads of five troopers and an emergency medic, everyone on the team assumed a non-threatening position and followed all instructions. The ASF troopers confiscated all weapons pending identification and questioning. Not long after the ASF had secured and cordoned off the area, two detectives arrived, a human woman and an android. The woman introduced herself as Detective Isabel Calasanz and began questioning the recruits as the android, Solagi-2, interviewed the other bystanders. Gereon and Taraea took the lead in answering the detective's questions, explaining that they were scheduled to meet Duravor Kreel of the Starfinder Society when the shooting broke out, and that they engaged the gang members in self-defense. The detective was curious as to how Gereon, of the prominent d'Amboise family came to be at the docks and involved with a Starfinder representative. With a wry grin Gereon answered,
>"No doubt my father will wonder the same, but be far less satisfied with the answer. Suffice to say I am exploring new ventures."

At this point, Solagi-2 joined Det Calasanz and shared his findings; the other bystanders not only corroborated the recruits' story, but were quite thankful for the group's quick actions. Satisfied with the initial findings, Det Calasanz instructed the troopers to return the recruits' weapons as they were free to go.

Once clear of the cordoned area, Nisk shared that she recovered Duravor's infoPad and they should go somewhere to review it in private. Gereon cheerily offered,
>"I know just the place! Not far away and a trusted establishment. Follow me!"

## Tattle Tails

Gereon's 'trusted establishment' ended up being a higher end gentleman's club. Clearly uncomfortable Taraea inquired,
>"A strip club? This is your idea of a 'trusted establishment', Gereon?"

Gereon just winked at the lashunta and flashed a roguish grin. Then turning to the hostess, he beamed his identification and instructed,
>"One of the suites please, no entertainment today, thank you, but I believe menus would be in order."

The hostess led them to one of the exclusive member's rooms, where Gereon ordered food and drinks for anyone interested. Before the group can begin their discussions, a female android swept into the room and greeted Gereon heartily. Gereon introduced Lonnith-7, the proprietor of the club, to the rest of the team. She welcomed the others and informed everyone that their lunch was arriving. After ensuring the food was to everyone's satisfaction, she bid them a good meal and departed.

Alone again, the group's discussion turned to the events at the dock as they ate. Nisk explained more about the two gangs involved in the shootout.
>"The Level 21 Crew are a street gang that claims Level 21 of Absalom Station’s lower decks as its territory. They're known criminal endeavors include theft, fencing stolen goods, gambling, prostitution, racketeering, and smuggling. The Downside Kings, however, are a nasty bunch. They control several decks of Absalom Station’s lower levels, or “Downside,” through a combination of intimidation and violence. Their illegal activities cover the whole spectrum, from extortion, fraud, robbery, smuggling, and theft, to drug and arms trafficking, kidnapping, murder-for-hire, and trafficking in sentient species."

The most puzzling aspect was how far the docks are from these two gangs' territory. The only clue was Nisk's brief parley with the Level-21 Crew member.
>"Level-21 got some kind of word that the Kings were gonna be killing one or more folks here and their boss sent them to stop them. I didn't have a chance to get anymore details before they hauled off."

Nisk easily accessed Duravor's infoPad. His last communications had been with someone another Starfinder named Chiskisk regarding pick up of the recruits for an orientation session at the Lorespire Complex. Cyscokt recognized the name as a high-ranking shirren Starfinder officer. Everyone agreed that the most sensible course of action was to head over to the Lorespire Complex and try to meet with Chiskisk. Prior to leaving the club, Gereon had Lonnith-7 distribute the funds from the retrieved credsticks to amongst the team.
