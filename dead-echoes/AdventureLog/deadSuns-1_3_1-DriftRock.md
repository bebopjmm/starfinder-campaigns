# Dead Suns 1.3: Phantoms of the Drift, Ch 1

## Scouting the Drift rock

Taraea wants to take the shuttle out to reconnoiter the Drift Rock before investigating on foot. The team brings along Nolkiek because they don't trust leaving the space goblin unsupervised on the Acreon.

- Nisk performs another sensors scan during the reconnoiter
  - reveal that the asteroid has no atmosphere and is primarily composed of rock and metal. Strangely, the sensors can pick up no additional information, as if the Drift Rock itself is interfering with the sensor readings.
  - Cyscokt notice one unusual feature: one side of the Drift Rock seems to have been sheared cleanly off, as if it was once part of a larger planetoid or celestial body. Also unlike on most asteroids, no impact craters mar the Drift Rockâ€™s surface, as if it had been somehow protected from the ravages of space for millions of years.
- Taraea noticed a rocky overhang concealing a cave entrance that seems to lead inside the asteroid.
  - Nevos-4 volunteered to check out the cave and located a passage running deeper into the Drift Rock

Decision is made to return to Acreon and make preparations for exploring the Drift Rock.
- Nevos-4 has everyone put on their zero-g clothing over their armor
- load the Eoxian embassy 'package' onto the Hippocampus
- transfer all of their gear back onto the Hippocampus as well as the noqual cocoons
- decide to bring along Nolkiek because, again, they don't trust leaving the space goblin unsupervised on the Acreon
- Cyscokt is insistent on giving Gereon another night's rest before attempting something as potentially taxing as exploring the Drift Rock.

### Gereon's Health

With Cyscokt's administrations, Gereon's condition is improved

- upgraded to *Weakened* state (2 of 2 saves required)
- cyscokt casts *Lesser Remove Condition* to remove the *sickened* condition from Gereon

## Entering the Drift Rock

Nevos-4 lands the Hippocampus in the cave they discovered in the Drift Rock and everyone disembarks, carrying extra gear due to zero-g conditions. No sooner than they enter the passageway that Nevos-4 has found, a disturbing sound reached them. Turning back, they looked in surprise and horror as the Hippocampus took off and departed from the Drift Rock autonomously.

- lots of swearing
- Acreon is still accessible via space walk
- Taraea - job is to investigate the Drift Rock so press on

Marching Order:

1. Nisk - using darkvision
2. Nevos-4 - using darkvision
3. Taraea - using flashlight integrated with armor
4. Cyscokt - using flashlight integrated with armor
5. Nolkiek - using Darkvision
6. Gereon - using flashlight integrated with armor

Cyscokt comments that the passageway is not a natural formation, but was excavated from the rock of the asteroid.
At the intersection a side passage goes to their left while the other passage continues straight. Decide to go straight. As it rounds a corner, Nisk sees that it opens up into cavern ahead.

- has everyone hold position while she scouts
- her stealth attempt doesn't evade Clara-247, who activates holo clone (3)

### Clara-247 Encounter

#### surprise

- Clara activates holo clone (3) and Nisk spots the activity

#### Round 1

- Nisk shouts warning to others, pushes off toward south wall for trick attack that eliminates on of the holo clones
- Taraea activates her solar armor and graviton attunement, pushing off toward ceiling and wall, but ends up off-kilter
- Nevos-4 pushes off into the chamber to south wall, ends stable and takes a shot at Clara, but misses
- Nolkiek pushes off toward ceiling and wall, then pushes off again, but ends up off kilter near Taraea
- Cyscokt flies down passage and steadies Taraea
- Clara-247 fires at Nevos-4, but misses
- Gereon pushes off to end of wall and ends up off-kilter

#### Round 2

- Nisk full attack with laser pistol and eliminates one of the holo clones
- Taraea pushes off to end in the center floor of the cavern and sticks the landing, but her laser pistol shot hits the boulder
- Nevos-4 full attack on Clara, and eliminates the final holo clone
- Nolkiek steadies, the pushes off into chamber
- Cyscokt flies into chamber and casts *Daze* on Clara, and she is dazed
- Gereon steadies then pushes down the passageway, off-kilter against

#### Round 3

- Nisk pushes off across room executing trick attack that hits Clara (6dmg )
- Fully attuned, Taraea pushes off to ceiling and uses *Black Hole* to pull Clara-247 out into the open
- Nevos-4 full attack on Clara, killing her!

### Development

Search of the body yields: freebooter armor 1, azimuth laser pistol with battery (20 charges), survival knife,
tactical shirren-eye rifle with 24 longarm rounds, clear spindle aeon stone, and credstick (300cr). They also uninstall her jump jets and take them.  
Who this android was remained a mystery, but she was obviously an operative. Among her gear was a dossier with each of the team members.

Move on to side passageway.

### Missing Crewman

As the passageway opens into a cavern, Nisk scouts ahead again and spots the floating corpse of the dead crewman. The others gather in the cavern, and Cyscokt inspects the body.

- *Detect Affliction* verifies this crewman didn't succumb to akata void death.
- Taraea takes the **backup generator** armor upgrade
- decide to return body to collective

The passage leading out clearly opens into another cavern after a short distance. Nisk back on scout.

### Cavern of the void

While stealthed, Nisk spots the void zombie and warns the team. Nevos-4 wants to draw it to them rather than funnel through passageway to it.

#### Suprise round

- Nisk fires laser pistol at void zombie and hits (3dmg )

#### Round 1

- Nevos-4 engages his boot clamps and readies autocannon to fire at zombie entering cavern
- Nisk takes another shot and nicks the void zombie (1dmg ) before pushing off back to previous cavern.

- weakened, Taraea activates solar armor and photon attunement, but misses with pike
- Cyscokt hits zombie with pulsecaster shot (2 dmg )

#### Round 2

- Nevos-4 switches to azimuth artillery laser, and kills the void zombie!

### Development

- Taraea will short rest (1RP) while Cyscokt checks her wounds. They confirm the creature is a void zombie and that the long 'tongue' is a feeding tendril- the fanged tail of the parasitic larva inside the void zombie.
- Exploring the cavern the finished wall immediately get attention
  - Taraea and Cyscokt (Life Science) and Nisk (Engineering) determine that the wall panels are some sort of ceramic-metallic plating that is as strong and durable as adamantine alloy, but is itself a substance unknown to Pact Worlds material science.
  - Cyscokt flies down the northern hallway and verifies is empties into open space where the Drift Rock has been cleanly shorn

Nevos-4 recommends following the south passage - the hallway is too smooth for gradual passage. Taraea agrees.

### Acreon Crew

Nisk stealths into the cavern and initially they don't see each other, but as she creeps along the wall a bit further, both sides notice the other.


#### Round 1

### Development

- Neither Taraea or Cyscokt were familiar with the horrific creature they had just fought.
- Nevos-4 recognizes one of the dead void zombies as the Acreon captain
- team collects the credstick, azimuth laser rifle and needler pistol
- quick check of north cavern before approaching door to south

## Exploring an Alien Complex

- nisk doesn't find any traps and its not locked
- quickly finds out artificial gravity is working in corridor beyond door
- team leaves unnecessary gear at entrance

Go left at intersection and discover something astounding.

### Ancient Control room

- Nisk, Taraea, and Cyscokt study the consoles but don't figure out much other than its advanced hybrid tech incorporating magic and technology.
  - looking it over they think its safe to try to access
- Gereon and Nisk attempt to access to computer console, but set off a trap  
  - nisk evades the arcing electricity but gereon take it full forece and is unconscious (20dmg )

- taraea readies a shot
- robot shoots nevos-4 with arc emitter (4dmg ) before advancing
  - taraea hits with pike (6dmg )
  - cyscokt CRITS with pulsecaster killing the robot!

### Development

- Cyscokt and Taraea both feel a presence, an... alien presence touching their minds.
- Nevos-4 wants to scout and secure where that robot came from, but Cyscokt strongly believes the team should regroup back on the Acreon. Taraea agrees with Cyscokt.
- Grab the rest of their gear at entrance and backtrack through passageways, then spacewalk to Acreon.

Back on board there is a lot of discussion about the day's events and discoveries. Taraea and Cyscokt share the strange alien presence that they felt while in the alien complex.

Cyscokt strongly recommends a full day's bedrest for both Gereon and Taraea.
- Taraea begrudingly agrees, but is firm that no one goes back to Drift Rock without full team
- Watches are to be set

**Advancement to Level 3!**

The night passed uneventfully. Next morning Gereon continued to fight void death.
- cyscokt uses medkit to *Treat Disease* granting +4 bonus to Gereon's check, and he succeeds
  - stays in Weakened state (1 of 2 needed saves)
- Gereon and Taraea each heal 1 Str ability damage

The next day both Gereon and Taraea had spent a full day of bed rest
- Gereon has healed all Str ability damage and Taraea heals 2 more Str points (only down 1)
- cyscokt uses medkit to *Treat Disease* granting +4 bonus to Gereon's check, and he succeeds- fully recovered from void death!
- Taraea meditates for **Graviton** *Sidereal Influence*

Team is ready to return to the Drift Rock. The spacewalk across to the Drift Rock goes without a hitch.
- gereon and nevos-4 notice that the corpse of Nolkiek, the space goblin, is no longer in the chamber where they left it
- taraea is able to wear the freebooter armor that belonged to clara-247

## The Alien Machinery

With nevos-4 and nisk in the lead, the team verifies the corridor that the sentry robot came from is now empty and is a dead end.
- cyscokt casts *detect magic* and verifies the machinery is a hybrid technology
- nisk does *Take 20* for Engineering check studying the machinery
  - concludes this set of machinery was for monitoring the status and operation of larger, unknown systems located elsewhere
  - the advanced technology of a type not seen in the Pact Worlds system
  - with gereon's aid, she recognize the symbols as error messages and warning indicators in an unknown language.

While everyone else was busy studying the machinery, nevos-4 found a sealed bolthole at the northwest corner of the corridor.
- nisk can't engineer it open, so brute force is applied
- between Taraea and nevos-4 hammering and blasting with artillery laser (full battery used) it takes a few minutes to break through

## Sealed Bolthole

- cyscokt inspects the body, its been here for quite some time. There are numerous wounds, but the cause of death was clearly self-inflicted head wound. Recognizes it as same woman as the driftdead that the team fought.
- collect her gear
  - nisk hacks into her infoPad and immediately finds her last recording - very sad
  - nisk, gereon, and taraea recognize the ship name and legend

Time to move on to the double doors.

## The Starship Grotto

As the team enters the grotto the see the starship, but also four dissected corpses on the floor, two human, one android, and one goblin. The android and goblin dissections are very fresh.
