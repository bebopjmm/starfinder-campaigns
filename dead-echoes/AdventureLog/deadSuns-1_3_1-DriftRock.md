# Dead Suns 1.3: Phantoms of the Drift, Ch 1

## Scouting the Drift rock

Taraea wants to take the shuttle out to reconnoiter the Drift Rock before investigating on foot. The team brings along Nolkiek because they don't trust leaving the space goblin unsupervised on the Acreon.

- Nisk performs another sensors scan during the reconnoiter
  - reveal that the asteroid has no atmosphere and is primarily composed of rock and metal. Strangely, the sensors can pick up no additional information, as if the Drift Rock itself is interfering with the sensor readings.
  - Cyscokt notice one unusual feature: one side of the Drift Rock seems to have been sheared cleanly off, as if it was once part of a larger planetoid or celestial body. Also unlike on most asteroids, no impact craters mar the Drift Rockâ€™s surface, as if it had been somehow protected from the ravages of space for millions of years.
- Taraea noticed a rocky overhang concealing a cave entrance that seems to lead inside the asteroid.
  - Nevos-4 volunteered to check out the cave and located a passage running deeper into the Drift Rock

Decision is made to return to Acreon and make preparations for exploring the Drift Rock.
- Nevos-4 has everyone put on their zero-g clothing over their armor
- load the Eoxian embassy 'package' onto the Hippocampus
- transfer all of their gear back onto the Hippocampus as well as the noqual cocoons
- decide to bring along Nolkiek because, again, they don't trust leaving the space goblin unsupervised on the Acreon
- Cyscokt is insistent on giving Gereon another night's rest before attempting something as potentially taxing as exploring the Drift Rock.

### Gereon's Health

With Cyscokt's administrations, Gereon's condition is improved

- upgraded to *Weakened* state (2 of 2 saves required)
- cyscokt casts *Lesser Remove Condition* to remove the *sickened* condition from Gereon

## Entering the Drift Rock

Nevos-4 lands the Hippocampus in the cave they discovered in the Drift Rock and everyone disembarks, carrying extra gear due to zero-g conditions. No sooner than they enter the passageway that Nevos-4 has found, a disturbing sound reached them. Turning back, they looked in surprise and horror as the Hippocampus took off and departed from the Drift Rock autonomously.

- lots of swearing
- Acreon is still accessible via space walk
- Taraea - job is to investigate the Drift Rock so press on

Marching Order:

1. Nisk - using darkvision
2. Nevos-4 - using darkvision
3. Taraea - using flashlight integrated with armor
4. Cyscokt - using flashlight integrated with armor
5. Nolkiek - using Darkvision
6. Gereon - using flashlight integrated with armor

Cyscokt comments that the passageway is not a natural formation, but was excavated from the rock of the asteroid.
At the intersection a side passage goes to their left while the other passage continues straight. Decide to go straight. As it rounds a corner, Nisk sees that it opens up into cavern ahead.

- has everyone hold position while she scouts
- her stealth attempt doesn't evade Clara-247, who activates holo clone (3)

- Nolkiek pushes off toward ceiling and wall, then pushes off again, but ends up off kilter near Taraea
- Cyscokt flies down passage and steadies Taraea
- Clara-247 fires at Nevos-4, but misses
- Gereon pushes off to end of wall and ends up off-kilter

### Development

Search of the body yields: freebooter armor 1, azimuth laser pistol with battery (20 charges), survival knife,
tactical shirren-eye rifle with 24 longarm rounds, clear spindle aeon stone, and credstick (300cr).  
Who this android was remained a mystery, but she was obviously an operative. Among her gear was a dossier with each of the team members.
