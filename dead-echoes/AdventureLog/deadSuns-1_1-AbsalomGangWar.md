# Dead Suns 1.1: Absalom Gang War, Ch 1

## Introductions

The appointment date had arrived. Gereon and Taraea currently lived at Absalom Station, while Nisk, Cyscokt, and Nevos-4 arrived by starship from their prior homes and boarded the shuttle Okimoro for transport to the station. As the shuttle Okimoro loaded its passengers Gereon and Taraea received the confirmation of meeting time and place, Dock 94 at 1030hrs, on their infoPads. Gereon applied a simple disguise to avoid unwanted attention prior to departing for the dock. Each of the recruits had been provided the name, picture, and short description of Durovar Kreel as well as each other.

The brightly lit docks of Absalom Station were abuzz with activity as travelers bustled by, preparing to board or disembarking from starships bound to or from any of dozens of worlds. Brash and swaggering starpilots, scurrying ysoki mechanics, and expectant colonists mingled with enigmatic kasatha mystics, hard-faced asteroid miners, imposing vesk mercenaries, and more, creating a microcosm of the abundance and variety of life in the Pact Worlds. New arrivals met friends, loved ones, or business contacts, and were whisked away into the humming activity of daily life on the vast space station. Beyond them, ground crews tended to the docked ships, and dockworkers in mechanized cargo lifters loaded and unloaded freight and baggage. A sharp tang of ozone hung in the air — a byproduct of electrical discharges from the docked ships — but underneath, the station’s atmosphere had a slightly used aroma. The docking bay’s deck plates thrummed beneath their feet as the recruits assembled, making brief greetings while looking for their designated Starfinder representative, Duravor Kreel.

Nisk was the first to notice the tall and lanky dwarf with a bristly, iron-gray beard and deep-set eyes. With his patched and stained coveralls, Duravor looked like just another dockerworker, but a badge with the Starfinder Society crest stood out on his chest. He was busy checking the infoPad in his hand, but as the group waved to gain his attention, Taraea noticed two groups of three toughs on the fringes of the docking bay furtively taking up defensive positions among stacks of cargo crates and machinery. Before she could warn the other of her concerns, two events happened. Duravor looked up and spotting the recruits waved and smiled warmly, and then the two groups of thugs opened fire on each other.

## Caught in the Crossfire

The air filled with laser blasts before any of the recruits could react. Bystanders screamed and began to flee in terror or dive for cover. Kreel froze, paralyzed with fear, and then, when a laser beam struck him in the neck, the dwarf fell to the deck and didn't move. Taking notice of Taraea, one of the thugs to the right of the recruits fired and struck her in the shoulder with his laser pistol. Infuriated, Taraea summoned her solar armor, the small mote that hovered near her head suddenly shining before enveloping the lashunta in a blue aura of stellar plasma, and then dashed to cover while drawing her longsword.

Recovering from their initial shock, the rest of the recruits sprung into action. Nisk dashed to cover, drawing her pistol and assessing the situation. Gereon recognized the thugs on the team's left side as Level-21 Crew gang members. Puzzled because this area was not their turf and the Level-21 Crew was not known for being particularly violent, he made a snap assessment that the other thugs must be worse. Plus they had already fired on his new acquaintances. Moving to cover, he shouted inspiration to his new teammates,
>"Those to right are the bigger threat. Get that thug that shot Taraea!"

Nevos-4 was more than willing to comply. Moving to cover, he shouldered his autocannon and returned fire, hitting the thug in the leg. Taraea dashed toward the thug, taking cover beside an abandoned vehicle. Shocked by the wanton violence and concerned for Durovar's condition, Cyscokt scurried towards the fallen dwarf. Nisk briefly watched the shirren with absolute astonishment before realizing she was still in the open, and then she darted for cover beside some nearby crates.

The gang members continued to trade laser fire. One of the thugs further ahead had caught on fire from a severe laser blast. Dropping to the ground and rolling, he successfully smothered out the flames. The Level-21 Crew got a couple of lucky hits on their enemies, killing one gang member and setting another on fire. The crew hadn't come out unscathed however, as one of their members who dashed across the dock to take cover behind a supply trailer was struck by a laser blast.

Gereon's harrasing pistol fire pinned the thug down and allowed Nevos-4 to line up a killing shot. With the immediate threat removed, Taraea dashed around to close in on the last gang member, who was busy smothering the flames. Seeing an opening, Nisk darted over to the Level-21 Crew gang member that had crossed the docks. Hand signaling a wish to parley, she asked,
>"Ayo who's troddin' jacked de aggro"

In between shots, the gang member responded,
>"Docks no man's. Rumint da Downdside Kings goin' wet and gaffer say push ta cap. We beast'em yok"

Having put out the flames, the last Downside Kings thug realized that all of his comrades were dead and started to flee, but Taraea caught up with him and struck him down with her longsword. Cyscokt reached Duravor and confirmed his worst fear, the dwarf was already dead with a hole burned completely through his neck from a laser beam.

The engagement won, the Level-21 Crew gang members whooped a victory cry, "Ownage!" before taking off back to the west. Almost as soon as the final gangmember has been dispatched, the security alerts sound, indicating that the Absalom Security Forces would soon arrive. Gereon, Nevos-4, and Taraea confirmed the Downside Kings thugs were all dead, taking their credsticks and disengaging the batteries from their laser pistols. Nisk joined Cyscokt at Duravor's side. Spotting the dead dwarf's infoPad, she grabbed it and stashed it within a cheek pouch.

When the security forces arrived, two squads of five troopers and an emergency medic, everyone on the team assumed a non-threatening position and followed all instructions. The ASF troopers confiscated all weapons pending identification and questioning. Not long after the ASF had secured and cordoned off the area, two detectives arrived, a human woman and an android. The woman introduced herself as Detective Isabel Calasanz and began questioning the recruits as the android, Solagi-2, interviewed the other bystanders. Gereon and Taraea took the lead in answering the detective's questions, explaining that they were scheduled to meet Duravor Kreel of the Starfinder Society when the shooting broke out, and that they engaged the gang members in self-defense. Solagi-2 joined Det Calasanz and shared his findings; the other bystanders not only corroborated the recruits' story, but were quite thankful for the group's quick actions. Satisfied with the initial findings, Det Calasanz instructed the troopers to return the recruits' weapons as they were free to go.

Once clear of the cordoned area, Nisk shared that she recovered Duravor's infoPad and they should go somewhere to review it in private. Gereon cheerily offered,
>"I know just the place! Not far away and a trusted establishment. Follow me!"

## Tattle Tails

Gereon's 'trusted establishment' ends up being a higher end gentleman's club. A hostess leads them to one of the exclusive members rooms, where Gereon declines entertainment, but has lunch ordered and drinks for anyone interested, his treat (55c).

- The group discusses the event
	- Gereon and Nisk share their knowledge of the two gangs
- Nisk easily access the information on Duravor's infoPad, and Chiskisk messages are prominent as the last communications
	- Cyscokt recognizes that name as a high-ranking Starfinder on Absalom Station, and the address as that of the Lorespire Complex, the Starfinder Society’s headquarters on the station.

The group decides the most sensible course of action is to head over the the Lorespire Complex and try to get a meeting with Chiskisk.

Prior to leaving, Nisk distributes the funds from the retrieved credsticks to amongst the team (90c each)
