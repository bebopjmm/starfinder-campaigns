# Dead Suns 1.1: Absalom Gang War

## Introductions

The appointment date had arrived. Gereon and Taraea currently lived at Absalom Station, while Redacted, Cyscokt, and Nevos-4 arrived by starship from their prior homes and boarded the shuttle Okimoro for transport to the station. As the shuttle Okimoro loaded its passengers Gereon and Taraea received the confirmation of meeting time and place, Dock 94 at 1030, on their infoPads. Gereon applied a disguise to avoid unwanted attention prior to departing for the dock. Each of the recruits had been provided the name, picture, and short description of Durovar Kreel as well as each other.

The brightly lit docks of Absalom Station were abuzz with activity as travelers bustled by, preparing to board or disembarking from starships bound to or from any of dozens of worlds. Brash and swaggering starpilots, scurrying ysoki mechanics, and expectant colonists mingled with enigmatic kasatha mystics, hard-faced asteroid miners, imposing vesk mercenaries, and more, creating a microcosm of the abundance and variety of life in the Pact Worlds. New arrivals met friends, loved ones, or business contacts, and were whisked away into the humming activity of daily life on the vast space station. Beyond them, ground crews tended to the docked ships, and dockworkers in mechanized cargo lifters loaded and unloaded freight and baggage. A sharp tang of ozone hung in the air — a byproduct of electrical discharges from the docked ships — but underneath, the station’s atmosphere had a slightly used aroma. The docking bay’s deck plates thrummed beneath their feet as the recruits assembled, making brief greetings while looking for their designated Starfinder representative, Duravor Kreel.

Redacted was the first to notice the tall and lanky dwarf with a bristly, iron-gray beard and deep-set eyes. With his patched and stained coveralls, Duravor looked like just another dockerworker, but a badge with the Starfinder Society crest stood out on his chest. He was busy checking the infoPad in his hand, but as the group waved to gain his attention, Taraea noticed two groups of three toughs on the fringes of the docking bay furtively taking up defensive positions among stacks of cargo crates and machinery. Before she could warn the other of her concerns, two events happened. Duravor looked up and spotting the recruits waved and smiled warmly, and then the two groups of thugs opened fire on each other.

## Caught in the Crossfire

Before any of the recruits could react, the air filled with laser blasts. Bystanders screamed and began to flee in terror or dive for cover. Kreel froze, paralyzed with fear, and then a laser beam struck him in the neck, and the dwarf fell to the deck and didn't move. Taking notice of Taraea, one of the thugs to the right of the recruits fired and struck her in the shoulder with his laser pistol. Infuriated Taraea summoned her solar armor as she drew her longsword and moved to cover. One of the thugs further ahead was severely wounded and caught on fire from a laser blast.

Recovering from their initial shock, the rest of the recruits sprung into action. Redacted dashed to cover, drawing her pistol and assessing the situation. Gereon recognized the thugs on the team's right side as Level-21 Crew gang members. Puzzled because this area was not their turf and the Level-21 Crew was not known for being particularly violent, he made a snap assessment that the other thugs must be something worse. Plus they had already fired on his teammates. Moving to cover, he shouted inspiration to his new teammates to focus on the thug that had shot Taraea. Nevos-4 was more than willing to comply. Moving to cover, he shouldered his autocannon and returned fire, hitting the thug in the leg. Taraea dashed toward the thug, taking cover at the abandoned vehicle. Disturbed by the wanton violence and concerned for Durovar's condition, Cyscokt started scrambling towards the fallen dwarf.

The gang members continued to trade laser fire. The one that was burning dropped to the ground, rolling and successfully smothering out the flames. The Level-21 Crew got another lucky hit on their enemies, setting a second gang member on fire. The crew didn't come out unscathed however, as their member who dashed across the dock to take cover behind a supply trailer was hit.

### Round 2

Actions:

- Redacted moves, asks LC1 what the situation is
- Nevos-4 kills DK3
- DK2 drops rolls and put out flames
- LC1 misses DK1 and yells at Redacted that they heard the DKs were doing something here and they came to confront them.
- LC2 shoots and kills DK1

### Round 3

Initiative Order:

- 17: Redacted
- 15: Nevos-4
- 13: Downside Kings
- 13: Level-21 Crew
- 8: Gereon
- 6: Cyscokt
- 4: Taraea

Actions:

- Redacted parleys with LC1, concerned that Cyscokt is now in the wide open
- Nevos-4 moves up to the DK thug he just killed, making sure he’s dead
- Panicked, DK2 gets up and flees to the east
- L21C realize they won, whoop and begin to take off to the west
- Gereon runs up to the dead DK thug, takes his laser pistol and credit stick
- Cyscokt confirms his worst fears, Duravor is quite dead
- Taraea catches up to DK2 and strikes him down with her longsword

### Development

Almost as soon as the final gangmember has been dispatched, the security alerts sound, indicating that the Absalom security forces would soon arrive:

- The group quickly takes the pistols and credit sticks from the other two dead gang members.
	- Nevos-4 disengages the batteries from the pistols
- Redacted swipes Duravor's infoPad and puts it in her cheek pouch
- Cyscokt makes sure no one is badly injured
- Gereon realizes he will have to drop the disguise due to security identification process, but can play up family connections

When the security forces arrive everyone on the team assumes a non-threatening position and follows all instructions. The forces dispatched are 2 squads of 6 that include one emergency medical personnel.
- security forces will confiscate the dead gang members laser pistols but don't inquire about any other personal items.
- they also confiscate all team member weapons for the time being and collect identification

Not long after the ASF secure the area, two detectives arrive, a human and an android (Solagi-2)

- After cleared to leave by the security forces (by now it is almost 1200), Gereon will guide the group to a trusted establishment that he knows not too far away to discuss what to do next
- reporter will be shortly behind the security forces and will want the scoop (this could be a recurring npc annoyance and possible help)

## Tattle Tails

Gereon's 'trusted establishment' ends up being a higher end gentleman's club. A hostess leads them to one of the exclusive members rooms, where Gereon declines entertainment, but has lunch ordered and drinks for anyone interested, his treat (55c).

- The group discusses the event
	- Gereon and Redacted share their knowledge of the two gangs
- Redacted easily access the information on Duravor's infoPad, and Chiskisk messages are prominent as the last communications
	- Cyscokt recognizes that name as a high-ranking Starfinder on Absalom Station, and the address as that of the Lorespire Complex, the Starfinder Society’s headquarters on the station.

The group decides the most sensible course of action is to head over the the Lorespire Complex and try to get a meeting with Chiskisk.

Prior to leaving, Redacted distributes the funds from the retrieved credsticks to amongst the team (90c each)

[Breaking News: Docking Bay 94](https://youtu.be/kd66fySRRLk)

## The Starfinder Society

The team reached the Lorespire Complex by 1445, traveling by robo-taxi from the Arms to the Ring sector (5c paid by Cyscokt). Checking in with the receptionist, they request to see Chiskisk. The receptionist points them toward a small waiting room and politely asks them to wait. After several minutes, a functionary arrives to lead them to a cluttered but clean office deep in the complex. Seated behind a polished and unadorned plastic desk, Chiskisk wears understated business clothes and is nervously flexing their antennae from side to side—a shirren expression of perplexity. Chiskisk welcomes the group, offers them refreshments (filtered water and processed-protein wafers), and bids them sit down before introducing themself.

Chiskisk is puzzled about their unescorted arrival at the Lorespire Complex, and asks them where the dwarf is. Gereon shares the tragic news of the gangfight at Dock 94 and Duravor's death. At this point the shirren gets down to business, speaking telepathically in the PCs’ heads.

> "I am sorry that I cannot welcome you to Absalom Station under better circumstances. I assure you that such attacks are not a daily occurrence, though I realize that is likely small comfort to you. I am pleased that none of you were seriously hurt, but I grieve for Duravor’s death. He was a valued member of the Society, and a friend. May the Lady of Graves be kind in her judgment of his soul.”

The shirren bows their head momentarily, then looks up, their compound eyes glittering.>“What puzzles me is the reason behind the attack.” Chiskisk taps a few commands into their computer. “According to the incident report just released by station security, two gangs were involved in the attack: the Downside Kings and the Level 21 Crew. Gang wars are not uncommon on the station, but they usually confine themselves to the more lawless sectors like the Puddles. It is rare for street gangs to battle openly in public areas like the docks. I cannot help but wonder whether all is as it seems. There must be a reason why those two gangs were at Docking Bay 94 at that time—the time of your arrival, coincidentally. But was it coincidence? Were you and Duravor just innocent bystanders caught in the crossfire, or might you and he have been specifically targeted? And if so, why?  “My understanding is that you are interested in becoming Starfinders, and since you were witnesses to the attack, I would like to ask you to investigate the incident on behalf of the Society. Find out exactly what happened and why. It may simply be a matter of being in the wrong place at the wrong time—I have no doubt station security will rule it so—but if Duravor was murdered, I would like to find justice for my friend. At the same time, this will give you the opportunity to demonstrate your own skills and abilities and show the Society that you are worthy of the title ‘Starfinder.’ Good luck.”

- Chiskisk gives their personal comm code to the group, so they can call and report as necessary
- Chiskisk also transfers 200 credits to each of the teammember’s accounts (a “signing bonus plus expenses,” the shirren calls it) and suggests they get settled on the station before starting their investigation.
	- recommends a small hotel called the Moons of Sleep. Located just a short walk from the parks and towers of the Eye, the hotel is centrally located, and has both efficiencies and suites available. Chiskisk provides a digital voucher that will qualify them for the Starfinder discount.
When asked about Duravor, the shirren can only share this,
> Duravor Kreel was a midranking member of the Starfinder Society. Most of his work focused on mineral prospecting, but he also took an interest in mentoring new and prospective members of the Society.

When asked, Chiskisk also provides them with Duravor's home address, a small apartment in the Drifter's End neighborhood of the Ring sector.

- the team decides to check out the apartment before going to the Moons of Sleep.

## Duravor's Apartment

Drifter's Edge is walkable from the Lorespire Complex. Using the infoPad to gain entry, they find Duravor's home to be a small, very unkempt efficiency apartment. Spotting a computer terminal in the living area, Redacted gets to work while the others search the rest of the apartment.

- checking the kitchenette, its obvious that Duravor subsisted on beer and takeout
	- Cyscokt notes that he seems to favor a restaurant called Mama Fats
- Taraea finds a curius token amongst his possessions
- Redacted has quite a bit of success scanning through the computer files
	- Duravor was a native of the Diaspora, the diffuse asteroid belt between Verces and Eox, and was known to have ties to dwarves and other mining groups in the region. An outspoken champion of miners’ rights, Kreel was active in challenging large corporate interests that exploited individual miners and laborers, including Astral Extractions.
	- Kreel had personally invested money in the Hardscrabble Collective. In addition, one of his cousins was a member of the group, but she died in a mining accident—the result of safety violations perpetrated by her contract employer, Astral Extractions.
- Gereon is familiar with Astral Extractions
	- Astral Extractions is a powerful mining conglomerate with business ties throughout the Pact Worlds. Most of the company’s operations are centered in the Diaspora and the rocky moons of the outer planets, but it has also begun sending scout vessels into the Vast in search of new claims. The company recently hired one of the Hardscrabble Collective’s ships, the Acreon, for one of these exploratory missions.
	- The public face of Astral Extractions is that of an ethical and respectable corporation, but outside of the public eye, some say the company uses hired muscle—corporate mercenaries, strikebreakers, and even criminal elements—as proxies to intimidate and threaten those who stand in its way.
- Gereon is not very familiar with Hardscrabble
	- The Hardscrabble Collective is a clan of stubborn asteroid miners that operates primarily among the scattered planetoids of the Diaspora. It has no offices or base of operations, but the clan members usually view the Armada—the ever-changing fleet of ships that orbit Absalom Station—as a central gathering place. Collective crews hire their ships out to a wide variety of business concerns, including Astral Extractions, which recently employed the Collective ship Acreon to scout for new mining prospects in the Vast.

Redacted recommends checking out a couple of the local watering holes — they may be able get some additional info on Duravor.

## Paralax Cantina

On the third try, the team finds a local establishment where Duravor was a regular. Once folks learn of Duravor's death, an impromptu wake commences.

- lots of confirmation of what team had learned about Duravor, but no new real insights.
- After a few drinks, the team gets some of the regular's to open up about the Hardscrabble Collective
	- While the Hardscrabble Collective calls itself a clan, it is more of a cooperative business enterprise, a coalition of dozens of ships’ crews who have banded together for mutual bene t and safety. While some of the Collective’s members are related, most of them are individuals from a dozen different races: humans, dwarves, androids, ysoki, and more. Nevertheless, the Hardscrabble Collective is as tightly knit as many families, and members  fiercely look after one another’s welfare.
	- Following the arrival of the Acreon and Astral Extractions’ claim on the ship and the Drift Rock, the Hardscrabble Collective contracted with an Absalom Station street gang called the Level 21 Crew to protect its members and its interests on the station until the dispute can be resolved.
- This opened discussion to Level-21 Crew
	- The Level 21 Crew may be a criminal gang, but they have a reputation in their territory (and neighboring levels) for promoting community empowerment, and many neighborhood residents tolerate or tacitly endorse their activities. The gang has also been known to hire itself out to defend marginalized and threatened groups or factions. A grizzled ysoki called Jabaxa currently leads the Level 21 Crew.
	- Fearing retribution from powerful corporate interests, the Hardscrabble Collective has recently hired the Level 21 Crew for protection.
- Talk of the Acreon and the Drift Rock spur lots of wild speculation and rumors.

The drinking and remembrances run late into the night (75cr tab split), and the team ends up crashing at a nearby sleep pods for the night.

## Further Investigations

Hangovers were rather brutal the next morning, but a greasy breakfast help ease the worst of it. Plans were made:

1. Get setup in the Moons of Sleep so that another night in a godawful sleep pod isn't necessary.
2. Gereon knows someone who might be able to dig up more details on Astral Extractions
3. Redacted has underworld connections that could shed some more light on Downside Kings and Level-21.

Gereon also has a message from his father. The news reports of the Dock 94 assault are out and Gereon's involvement is public. His father is cutting him off.

### Moons of Sleep

The team walks to the Moons of Sleep, which also helps work the self-inflicted toxins out of their systems. The Starfinder discount is on weekly rates: 16cr for an efficiency, and 50cr for a small two-bed suite.

- everyone ops for an efficiency room, except for Gereon who chooses a suite.

After a much needed freshening up, they head for lunch with Gereon's contact.

### The Corporate Contact

Gereon is able to squeeze some critical information from his corporate contact, but the meal tab seemed excessive to most of the team (115cr):

- Following the arrival of the Acreon, Astral Extractions secretly hired a violent Absalom Station street gang called the Downside Kings to coerce the Hardscrabble Collective into abandoning its claims on the Acreon and the Drift Rock.

### A Visit to Little Akiton

The team tracks down Bezilt, a ysoki dock foreman. He reluctantly shares some information on the Downside Kings:

- Turnover among the Downside Kings’ leadership is high, but the gang’s current boss is a barbarous human woman named Ferani Nadaz.
- Astral Extractions recruited the Downside Kings to threaten the Hardscrabble Collective and pressure the miners into handing over the Acreon and the Drift Rock to the company without dispute.

He suggests that if the team really wants to know more about stuff like this, that they shoud go visit Diamond of Diamond Defense and Surplus down in the Spire.

### Diamond Defense and Surplus

They find the shop in the Spire and are greeted by Diamond. She listens to their story and thinks a bit. She confirms that has useful information for the team and proposes a trade.

- Pest Control Mission: a group of goblins have encroached on an area she uses for business. Deal with them.


### Goblins in Botscrap

The team follows the directions to the Botscrap location and arrive without incident. Nevos-4 and Redacted scout the area and determine good locations to hunker down and wait. In the dim light it is difficult to see well, and the team notices the approaching two scouts at the same time the scouts notice them:

#### Round 1
- Nevos-4 misses
- Gereon gets in a great shot that badly wounds G-1
- Cyscokt holds position
- goblin scavengers scurry around
- Redacted misses both trick attack and shot
- G-1 moves to total cover
- G-2 moves to cover and readies shot against anyone coming into view north
- Taraea activates solar armor and graviton attunement (1) then moves around
	- G2 gets critical hit on Taraea

#### Round 2
- Nevos-4 moves to bridge and spots G-4 in the open, but misses again
- Gereon moves and attempts to provide covering fire for Taraea, but his pistol jams
- Cyscokt moves to assist Taraea
- G-3 moves and fires at Nevos-4, missing
- G-4 moves to cover and fires at Cyscokt, hitting for 1 dmg
- G-5 fires at Nevos-4, hitting for 2 dmg
- Redacted charges next to Nevos-4, dropping prone and shooting at G-3, killing it
- G-1 is fleeing
- G-2 fires at Taraea and hits again for 3 dmg
- Taraea take burning dmg (3), stay on graviton attunement (2), falls prone to smother flames, but to no avail

#### Round 3
- Nevos-4 moves to cover and fires at G-2, killing it
- Gereon moves south to cover, but it takes a full action to get there
- Cyscokt aids Taraea in dousing the flames
- G-4 fires at Cyscokt, hitting for 3 dmg
- G-5 fires at Gereon, hitting for 3 dmg
- Redacted moxies up, heads south and drops prone before killing G-4
- G-1 escapes
- Taraea takes burning dmg (3), stays on graviton attunement (3), and successfully smothers the flames

#### Round 4
- Nevos-4 moves west and readies to shoot if G-5 flees west
- Gereon moves to cover south and issues a "Get'em" against G-5
- Cyscokt casts mystic cure on Taraea (6HP) restoring all lost HP
- G-5 runs away west
	- Nevos-4 hits it for 5 dmg
- Redacted gives chase, full move
- Taraea dashes south

#### Round 5
- Nevos-4 dashes south
- Gereon moves east and fire at the fleeing G-5, killing it

#### Development
- 10 min rest has everyone at full strength
- Four sets of goblin ears are collected
- Team returns to Diamond Defense and Surplus
	- Diamond impressed with results, pays the 100cr bounty on the ears
	- Diamond tells them that if they want to talk to Jabaxa, then go to Mama Fats on Level-21 and request *Borelian Felgercarb Nuggets*
- Head back to the Ring area for celebratory drinks (50cr from party fund) and a good night's sleep

## Mama Fats

Everyone catches up on sleep and its almost noon before they have gathered to go check out Mama Fats. They reach Level-21 without incident. The area is the crowded, run-down lower half of Absalom Station. The surrounding neighborhood is low-end, but not quite a slum.
- Redacted recognizes and points out the graffiti on the walls as gang tags marking this as territory of the Level 21 Crew.

The bodega is clean, and a female halfling greets them. The team orders some lunch (15gp from party fund)
- Gereon sweet talks her from indifferent to friendly
- After lunch, Redacted requests the *Borelian Felgercarb Nuggets* to go. Mama Fats becomes suspicious, but then tells the team to come back tomorrow at 3 pm.

Team has downtime for the rest of the day

### Meeting Jabaxa

The team shows back up a Mama Fats at the appointed time.  They are escorted to a room in the back of the bodega, where the gang’s leader, Jabaxa, waits for them along with two of his gang members. Gereon and Redacted greet him politely and the ysoki invites them to have a seat. He then pours out a shot of bathtub moonshine for each of them as a gesture of hospitality before asking them their business.
- Redacted provides a brief summary of their investigation
- Jabaxa  flatly denies that his crew killed Duravor Kreel (they don’t even know who he was) and blames the murder on the Downside Kings. He claims that it was the Kings who started the shootout in Docking Bay 94, as well; his crew was there only to oppose them.

Gereon and Taraea succeed at diplomatically improving his attitude (eventually to helpful)
- another round of drinks and swapping some stories

Jabaxa tells the team about the nightclub, Fusion Queen, that the Downside Kings use as a front for their illegal activities.
- His gang can't be directly involved or a full-blown gangwar could be incited, which would put the citizens of Level-21 in danger.

## The Fusion Queen

Redacted convinces the team that they should at least check out the club before engaging in any kind of assault. They swing by the club and Redacted quickly recognizes the club’s logo, a stylized crown, as a variant of the Downside Kings’ symbol. As they approach the bouncer's immediately draw their laser pistols and inform them of the no weapons policy.
- Gereon was able to calm them down with a story that the team had just arrived on station from completing a mission and was looking for a place to unwind. They would drop off their gear and return later.

Heading back to the Moons of sleep, the team decided to follow through on the story an return to the club that evening without weapons.
- passing security check, they bouncers let them in
- they learn the basic layout of the club and take special note of the 'staff only' double doors.
  - Redacted verifies the door is locked using a keycard that all staff have
- the team has a few drinks (15cr) and dances. Gereon mildly questions the waitress and Redacted the bartender about the Downside Kings, but there is no indication that the staff knows anything about the gang.

After a few hours the team retires back to the Moons of Sleep.

### Formulating a Plan
Its obvious to everyone that they will need to get access to that staff area, but the crowd and staff are all civilians.
- Nevos-4 strongly thinks some additional gear would be helpful, and Diamond probably has everything they could need
- Redacted thinks she could swipe the keycard off a staff person with a proper distraction, but the team needs weapons inside the club
- Cyscokt cautions against unnecessary violence and bloodshed
- Taraea agrees that the team must avoid civilian injury

**Questions**:
1. How to deal with front door bouncers (obviously gang-members)?
  - flash grenades and daze spells to soften them up
2. How to get into the staff-only area?
  - swiping a keycard from waitress seems achievable
3. How to get weapons into the club?
  - Redacted can try to stash a gun or two in cheek pouches, but that is risky

#### The Plan
1. Redacted and Gereon will enter club early and with task of securing a keycard from one of the staff.
  - recon the backroom
2. Once they have a keycard, the other three will take out the front door bouncers.
  - flash grenade and daze spells to hinder them until taken out
3. Move fast to staff backroom and find Ferani

### Shopping
Nevos-4 recommends getting some additional gear, primarily grenades and healing serums. Diamonds Defense and Surplus has everything they need:
- Nevos-4 buys a flash grenade and 2 MK1b healing serums
- Cyscokt buys a needler pistol and 2 MK1b healing serums loaded into darts
- Redacted has a called fusion placed on her pistol and buy 1 MK1b healing serum
- Gereon buys a flash grenade and 1 MK1b healing serum
- Taraea buys 2 MK1b healing serums

### Execution
Redacted leaves her pistol with Taraea and with Gereon's aid disguises the flash grenade before placing it in a cheek pouch. She easily keeps it unnoticed from the front door bouncer that searches her. Once inside, Gereon picks out his mark, the waitress he flirted with last time. As he distracts her with an odd drink order, Redacted successfully swipes her keycard.

The two then ease over to the staff room doors. Gereon steps in sees the three goons playing cards. They immediately challenge him, and he gives a story about the waitress claiming to meet him back here, and that he's obviously the butt of her joke. They buy to story and chuckle, but then tell him to scram and don't come back in here or he'll find more trouble than a lying bar wench.

Gereon and Redacted relay their situation and findings over the personal comms. Its time to fully execute the strike. Redacted gives Gereon the flash grenade. The three outside approach, weapons at the ready. The bouncers spot them and draw weapons, issuing a challenge.

### Development
Combat is over, but the security forces can't be long in coming, so Redacted yells for everyone to grab anything useful and get go.
- Gereon and Cycokt loot Vrok's artillery laser, spare battery, credstick
- Redacted and Taraea loot Ferani and the desk of ammo, infoPad, credstick
	- Nevos-4 discovers storage door is locked, but Redacted tosses him the keycard, which opens it
	- Nevos-4 and Taraea loot to storage room
- Redacted easily hacks the infoPad
	- numerous files and communication records that detail Downside Kings' criminal activity
	- which gives her access to club security camera system, and she is able to erase all footage of the past half hour.

There isn't time to fully investigate the files and messages here, so the team heads out. With the smoke dissipated, the frightened patrons are fleeing, and the team manages to slip into the crowd. Sirens of approaching security forces can be heard approaching. The team makes their escape.
- Cyscokt performs *Healing Touch* on Gereon and casts *Mystic Cure* on Taraea

## Conclusion

With time to analyze Ferani's infoPad, Redacted finds all kinds of incriminating information. Of primary interest is communications proving that an employee of Astral Extractions hired the Downside Kings to eliminate Duravor Kreel oth as a message to the Hardscrabble Collective that the corporation means business and to keep the Starfinder Society from getting too curious about the Acreon and the Drift Rock.
