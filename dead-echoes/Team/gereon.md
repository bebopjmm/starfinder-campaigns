**Glamered**: As a standard action, a weapon with the glamered fusion can be commanded to change its appearance to assume the form of another object of similar size. The weapon retains all its properties (including bulk) when disguised but does not radiate magic. Only true seeing or similar magic reveals the true nature of a glamered weapon while it is in disguise. After a glamered weapon is used to make an attack, this fusion is suppressed for 1 minute.

### Abilities

#### Racial

- **Skilled**: +1 skill rank at each level

#### Icon

- **Icon Knowledge**: You are hooked deeply into the culture of to the world of corporate culture, and know all the movers and shakers. When attempting a Profession or Culture check to recall knowledge about corporations and their executives, reduce the DC by 5. Diplomacy is a class skill for you, though if it is a class skill from the class you take at 1st level, you instead gain a +1 bonus to Diplomacy checks.

#### Envoy

- **Envoy Improvisation (DC 13)**: little tricks that bolster allies, confound enemies, or change the ebb and flow of battle using guile, inspiration, or luck.
	- **Get 'Em (Ex)**: As a move action, you can choose one enemy within 60 feet. Until the start of your next turn, you and your allies gain a +1 morale bonus to attack rolls made against that enemy. The bonus persists even if the enemy moves beyond 60 feet or out of line of sight or hearing
	- **Inspiring Boost (7sta)**: As a standard action, you can signal an ally within 30 feet who has taken damage from any attack made by a significant enemy at any point after your last turn ended. That ally regains 7 Stamina Points. Once an ally has benefited from your inspiring boost, that ally can’t gain the benefits of your inspiring boost again until he takes a 10-minute rest to recover Stamina Points.
- **Expertise**: +1d6 insight bonus to Sense Motive checks
- **Skill Expertise**: expertise insight bonus to Diplomacy checks
	- **Well Informed**: You keep yourself as up to date as possible about the events and major figures of any region you are in. Once you have been in a settlement or region for at least 24 hours, when you attempt a Diplomacy check to gather information, you can forgo your expertise die to attempt the check as a swift action (rather than the normal 1d4 hours).
- **Weapon Specialization**: basic melee weapons, small arms

#### Feats

- **Diversion**: When you successfully use Bluff to create a distraction, you can allow an ally to attempt a Stealth check to hide (instead of attempting to hide yourself). You can attempt to allow multiple allies to use Stealth to hide, but you take a –5 penalty for every ally after the first, and on a failed check no ally can attempt to hide.
- **Weapon Focus (small arms)**: +1 attack bonus with small arms
- **Veiled Threat**: When you successfully use the Intimidate skill to bully a creature, after the duration of its helpful attitude ends, its attitude toward you becomes indifferent rather than hostile.

## Background

Gereon d’Amboise was born to wealth and privilege at Absalom Station as the oldest son of a very prominent corporate executive specializing at negotiating business deals. He was being groomed to eventually take over the business and had achieved great publicity and recognition. Gereon had become very disenchanted, however, with the corruption between corporations and governments and the ever expanding income inequality.

When the Starfinder Society's initiated a recruitment drive following the disasterous Scoured Stars incident, Gereon reached out to them through backchannels. He believed that they represented an opportunity to make a difference for the good all individuals rather than shareholders and a elite few. The Second Seeker faction took immediate notice and had a recruitment offer covertly issued. Gereon's father found out about the offer and threatened to totally cut Gereon off if he pursued it. Undaunted, Gereon accepted the offer and its instructions for meeting with Starfinder representative, Duravor Kreel.

## Personality
### Traits

- I weave flattery into my speech
