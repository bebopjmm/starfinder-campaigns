**Backup Generator**: can connect charged electric items such as batteries to this miniature generator to recharge them. The electricity comes from the kinetic energy of your movement, which generates 1 charge every 10 minutes of movement. No more than one item can be plugged in at a time, and the generator doesn’t produce charges when you’re resting or otherwise stationary.

### Abilities

#### Racial

- **Blindsense**: Shirrens’ sense vibrations in the air—out to 30 feet. A shirren ignores the Stealth bonuses from any form of visual camouflage, invisibility, and the like when attempting a Perception check opposed by a creature’s Stealth check. Even on a successful Perception check, any foe that can’t be seen still has total concealment (50% miss chance) against a shirren, and the shirren still has the normal miss chance when attacking foes that have concealment. A shirren is still flat-footed against attacks from creatures it can’t see.
- **Communalism**: Once per day, as long as an ally is within 10 feet, a shirren can roll a single attack roll or skill check twice and take the higher result.
- **Cultural Fascination**: +2 racial bonus to Culture and Diplomacy checks.
- **Limited Telepathy**: Shirrens can communicate telepathically with any creatures within 30 feet with whom they share a language. Conversing telepathically with multiple creatures simultaneously is just as difficult as listening to multiple people speak.

#### Spacefarer

- **Spacefarer Knowledge**: your knowledge of biology and topology to inure yourself to alien hazards. Reduce the DC of Physical Science checks to recall knowledge about strange new worlds or features of space by 5. Physical Science is a class skill for you, though if it is a class skill from the class you take at 1st level, you instead gain a +1 bonus to Physical Science checks.

#### Mystic

- **Healing Touch (15hp)**: Once per day, you can spend 10 minutes to magically heal an ally up to 5hp per mystic level.
- **Star Shaman Connection**
	- **Walking the Void**: Cyscokt is immune to the harmful environmental effects of outer space and vacuum. He gains a fly speed of 20 feet while in space. In addition, whenever he can see the stars, he can determine his precise location.
	- **Starlight Form**: Cyscokt can transform himself into blazing starlight as a standard action. His body sheds normal light in a 30-foot radius, and he gains the benefits of concealment (20% miss chance). He can maintain his starlight form for **3** minutes per day; this duration does not need to be continuous, but it must be used in 1-minute increments. He can forgo the ability's concealment and blinding aspects to instead simply shed light, though this still counts against the ability’s duration for the day.
- **Mindlink**: You can form a mental link with creatures you touch, communicating information rapidly through it. You can use mindlink at will as a spell-like ability, though only once per day on any given individual.
- **Weapon Specialization**: basic melee weapons, small arms

#### Feats

- **Medical Expert**: You can use the Medicine skill in conjunction with a medpatch or sprayflesh to treat deadly wounds as a full action. When used in this way, the medpatch or sprayflesh does not perform any of its normal functions. You can also use the Medicine skill to provide long-term care with just a medkit.
- **Skill Focus (Medicine)**: +3 insight bonus

## Background

Cyscokt was born in the Diaspora to a 3-member married spacefaring family. Always a lover of space travel and fascinated with the Pact Worlds, he dreamed of seeing more of the galaxy. With the full support of his family he became an acolyte of the Desnan church, traveling with a Desnan mystic.

The Starfinder Society's recent recruitment drive following the disastrous Scoured Stars incident caught Cyscokt's attention and appealed to his desire to travel, learn, and make a difference. With the approval of his teacher, he submitted an application. The Wayfinders faction liked his application and Cyscokt received a recruitment offer with starship passage to Absalom Station to meet Duravor Kreel.
