**Ulrikka Duster**: the Ulrikka duster fusion, which causes any weapon with it to take on an armored, stocky appearance. Attacks made with weapons with this fusion ignore half of a target item’s hardness

### Abilities

#### Android

- **Constructed**:
	- androids count as both humanoids and constructs (whichever effect is worse) for effects targeting creatures by type.
	- +2 racial bonus to saving throws against disease, mind-affecting effects, poison, and sleep, unless those effects specifically target constructs.
	- do not breathe or suffer the normal environmental effects of being in a vacuum.
- **Exceptional Vision**: low-light and darkvision 60 ft
- **Flat Effect**: -2 penalty to Sense Motive checks, +2 to DC of Sense Motive checks against them
- **Upgrade Slot**: single armor upgrade slot in their bodies. Regardless of whether androids are wearing physical armor, they can use this slot to install any one armor upgrade that could be installed into light armor.
	- **Jump Jets** (Cap: 20, Usage: 2/action): can activate jump jets as part of a move action in order to fly during your movement. You can fly up to 30 feet (average maneuverability) with a maximum height of 10 feet, or you can fly up to 20 feet straight up. You must land at the end of your move action. Jump jets can’t lift you if you’re encumbered.

#### Ace Pilot

- **Ace Pilot Knowledge**: Reduce the DC of Culture checks to recall knowledge about starship and vehicle models and parts as well as famous hotshot pilots by 5. Piloting is a class skill for you, though if it is a class skill from the class you take at 1st level, you instead gain a +1 bonus to your Piloting checks.

#### Soldier (Guard)

- **Armor Training**: reduce the armor check penalty of armor you wear by 1 (to a minimum of 0) and increase the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed by your armor by 1.
- **Armored Advantange**: +1 to KAC when wearing armor
- **Weapon Specialization**: basic and advanced melee weapons, small arms, long arms, heavy weapons, sniper weapons

#### Feats

- **Toughness**: For every character level you have (and whenever you gain a new level), you gain 1 Stamina Point. In addition, you gain a +4 bonus to Constitution checks to continue running, to avoid damage from a forced march, to hold your breath, and to avoid damage from starvation or thirst. You also gain a +4 bonus to Fortitude saving throws to avoid taking damage from hot or cold environments, to withstand the harmful effects of thick and thin atmospheres, to avoid choking when breathing in heavy smoke, and to avoid fatigue caused by sleep deprivation.
- **Weapon Focus (heavy weapons)**: +1 attack bonus to heavy weapons
- **Deadly Aim (+1dmg)**: When you take the attack or full attack action with weapons, you can take a –2 penalty to your attack rolls to deal additional damage equal to half your base attack bonus.

## Background

Nevos-4 was 'born' at a foundry on Aballon, where it was immediately transitioned into military training. Upon certification as a soldier class android with piloting specialization, it decided against the traditional path of military or corporate security service. Instead Nevos-4 chose freelance for the greater independence and better opportunity to help eliminate the illegal manufacture and slavery of androids.

The Starfinder Society's recent recruitment drive following the disastrous Scoured Stars incident caught Nevos-4's attention. It believes that by aligning with the Starfinder Society it will be able to do the most good towards protecting the Pact Worlds. The Exo-Guardian took interest in it's application, and Nevos-4 received a recruitment offer with starship passage to Absalom Station to meet Duravor Kreel.

## Personality
### Traits

- I can stare down a nihili without flinching.
- I can't stand the sight of an unfair fight.

### Ideals

- **Greater Good**: A soldier's duty is to place their life in peril for the defense of others.
- **Responsibility**: I do what I must and obey just authority.

### Flaws

- I am afraid of any form of enslavement, but particularly one that would force me to fight against my will
