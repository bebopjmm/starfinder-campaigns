# Dead Suns 1.1: Absalom Gang War

## Introductions

The appointment date had arrived. Gereon and Tarea currently lived at Absalom Station, while Redacted, Cyscokt, and Nevos-4 arrived by starship from their prior homes and boarded the shuttle Okimoro for transport to the station. As the shuttle Okimoro loaded its passengers Gereon and Tarea received the confirmation of meeting time and place, Dock 94 at 1030, on their infoPads. Gereon applied a disguise to avoid unwanted attention prior to departing for the dock. Each of the recruits had been provided the name, picture, and short description of Durovar Kreel as well as each other.

The brightly lit docks of Absalom Station were abuzz with activity as travelers bustled by, preparing to board or disembarking from starships bound to or from any of dozens of worlds. Brash and swaggering starpilots, scurrying ysoki mechanics, and expectant colonists mingled with enigmatic kasatha mystics, hard-faced asteroid miners, imposing vesk mercenaries, and more, creating a microcosm of the abundance and variety of life in the Pact Worlds. New arrivals met friends, loved ones, or business contacts, and were whisked away into the humming activity of daily life on the vast space station. Beyond them, ground crews tended to the docked ships, and dockworkers in mechanized cargo lifters loaded and unloaded freight and baggage. A sharp tang of ozone hung in the air — a byproduct of electrical discharges from the docked ships — but underneath, the station’s atmosphere had a slightly used aroma. The docking bay’s deck plates thrummed beneath their feet as the recruits assembled, making brief greetings while looking for their designated Starfinder representative, Duravor Kreel.

Redacted was the first to notice the tall and lanky dwarf with a bristly, iron-gray beard and deep-set eyes. With his patched and stained coveralls, Duravor looked like just another dockerworker, but a badge with the Starfinder Society crest stood out on his chest. He was busy checking the infoPad in his hand, but as the group waved to gain his attention, Taraea noticed two groups of three toughs on the fringes of the docking bay furtively taking up defensive positions among stacks of cargo crates and machinery. Before she could warn the other of her concerns, two events happened. Duravor looked up and spotting the recruits waved and smiled warmly, and then the two groups of thugs opened fire on each other.

## Caught in the Crossfire

Before any of the recruits could react, the air filled with laser blasts. Bystanders screamed and began to flee in terror or dive for cover. Kreel froze, paralyzed with fear, and then a laser beam struck him in the neck, and the dwarf fell to the deck and didn't move. Taking notice of Tarea, one of the thugs to the right of the recruits fired and struck her in the shoulder with his laser pistol. Infuriated Taraea summoned her solar armor as she drew her longsword and moved to cover. One of the thugs further ahead was severely wounded and caught on fire from a laser blast.

Recovering from their initial shock, the rest of the recruits sprung into action. Redacted dashed to cover, drawing her pistol and assessing the situation. Gereon recognized the thugs on the team's right side as Level-21 Crew gang members. Puzzled because this area was not their turf and the Level-21 Crew was not known for being particularly violent, he made a snap assessment that the other thugs must be something worse. Plus they had already fired on his teammates. Moving to cover, he shouted inspiration to his new teammates to focus on the thug that had shot Taraea. Nevos-4 was more than willing to comply. Moving to cover, he shouldered his autocannon and returned fire, hitting the thug in the leg. Taraea dashed toward the thug, taking cover at the abandoned vehicle. Disturbed by the wanton violence and concerned for Durovar's condition, Cyscokt started scrambling towards the fallen dwarf.

The gang members continued to trade laser fire. The one that was burning dropped to the ground, rolling and successfully smothering out the flames. The Level-21 Crew got another lucky hit on their enemies, setting a second gang member on fire. The crew didn't come out unscathed however, as their member who dashed across the dock to take cover behind a supply trailer was hit.

### Round 2

- Redacted moves, asks LC1 what the situation is
- Nevos-4 kills DK3

- Nevos-4 moves up to the DK thug he just killed, making sure he’s dead
- Panicked, DK2 gets up and flees to the east

- Gereon runs up to the dead DK thug, takes his laser pistol and credit stick
- Cyscokt confirms his worst fears, Duravor is quite dead
- Taraea catches up to DK2 and strikes him down with her longsword

### Development

Almost as soon as the final gangmember has been dispatched, the security alerts sound, indicating that the Absalom security forces would soon arrive:

- The group quickly takes the pistols and credit sticks from the other two dead gang members.
	- Nevos-4 disengages the batteries from the pistols
- Redacted swipes Duravor's infoPad and puts it in her cheek pouch
- Cyscokt makes sure no one is badly injured
- Gereon realizes he will have to drop the disguise due to security identification process, but can play up family connections

When the security forces arrive everyone on the team assumes a non-threatening position and follows all instructions. The forces dispatched are 2 squads of 6 that include one emergency medical personnel.
- security forces will confiscate the dead gang members laser pistols but don't inquire about any other personal items.
- they also confiscate all team member weapons for the time being and collect identification

Not long after the ASF secure the area, two detectives arrive, a human and an android (Solagi-2)

- After cleared to leave by the security forces (by now it is almost 1200), Gereon will guide the group to a trusted establishment that he knows not too far away to discuss what to do next
- reporter will be shortly behind the security forces and will want the scoop (this could be a recurring npc annoyance and possible help)

## Tattle Tails

Gereon's 'trusted establishment' ends up being a higher end gentleman's club. A hostess leads them to one of the exclusive members rooms, where Gereon declines entertainment, but has lunch ordered and drinks for anyone interested, his treat (55c).

- The group discusses the event
	- Gereon and Redacted share their knowledge of the two gangs
- Redacted easily access the information on Duravor's infoPad, and Chiskisk messages are prominent as the last communications
	- Cyscokt recognizes that name as a high-ranking Starfinder on Absalom Station, and the address as that of the Lorespire Complex, the Starfinder Society’s headquarters on the station.

The group decides the most sensible course of action is to head over the the Lorespire Complex and try to get a meeting with Chiskisk.

Prior to leaving, Redacted distributes the funds from the retrieved credsticks to amongst the team (90c each)

## The Starfinder Society

The team reached the Lorespire Complex by 1445, traveling by robo-taxi from the Arms to the Ring sector (5c paid by Cyscokt). Checking in with the receptionist, they request to see Chiskisk. The receptionist points them toward a small waiting room and politely asks them to wait. After several minutes, a functionary arrives to lead them to a cluttered but clean office deep in the complex. Seated behind a polished and unadorned plastic desk, Chiskisk wears understated business clothes and is nervously  exing their antennae from side to side—a shirren expression of perplexity. Chiskisk welcomes the group, offers them refreshments (filtered water and processed-protein wafers), and bids them sit down before introducing themself. 

Chiskisk is puzzled about their unescorted arrival at the Lorespire Complex, and asks them where the dwarf is. Gereon shares the tragic news of the gangfight at Dock 94 and Duravor's death. At this point the shirren gets down to business, speaking telepathically in the PCs’ heads.

> "I am sorry that I cannot welcome you to Absalom Station under better circumstances. I assure you that such attacks are not a daily occurrence, though I realize that is likely small comfort to you. I am pleased that none of you were seriously hurt, but I grieve for Duravor’s death. He was a valued member of the Society, and a friend. May the Lady of Graves be kind in her judgment of his soul.” 

The shirren bows their head momentarily, then looks up, their compound eyes glittering.>“What puzzles me is the reason behind the attack.” Chiskisk taps a few commands into their computer. “According to the incident report just released by station security, two gangs were involved in the attack: the Downside Kings and the Level 21 Crew. Gang wars are not uncommon on the station, but they usually confine themselves to the more lawless sectors like the Puddles. It is rare for street gangs to battle openly in public areas like the docks. I cannot help but wonder whether all is as it seems. There must be a reason why those two gangs were at Docking Bay 94 at that time—the time of your arrival, coincidentally. But was it coincidence? Were you and Duravor just innocent bystanders caught in the crossfire, or might you and he have been speci cally targeted? And if so, why?  “My understanding is that you are interested in becoming Starfinders, and since you were witnesses to the attack, I would like to ask you to investigate the incident on behalf of the Society. Find out exactly what happened and why. It may simply be a matter of being in the wrong place at the wrong time—I have no doubt station security will rule it so—but if Duravor was murdered, I would like to find justice for my friend. At the same time, this will give you the opportunity to demonstrate your own skills and abilities and show the Society that you are worthy of the title ‘Starfinder.’ Good luck.”

- Chiskisk does give their personal comm code to the group, so they can call and report if necessary
- Chiskisk also transfers 200 credits to each of the teammember’s accounts (a “signing bonus plus expenses,” the shirren calls it) and suggests they get settled on the station before starting their investigation.
	- recommends a small hotel called the Moons of Sleep. Located just a short walk from the parks and towers of the Eye, the hotel is centrally located, and has both efficiencies and suites available. Furthermore, the Moons offers discounted lodging to Starfinders who book rooms for at least a week’s stay: 16 credits per week for an efficiency, or 50 credits per week for a small, two-bed suite.

When asked about Duravor, the shirren can only share this,
> Duravor Kreel was a midranking member of the Starfinder Society. Most of his work focused on mineral prospecting, but he also took an interest in mentoring new and prospective members of the Society.
