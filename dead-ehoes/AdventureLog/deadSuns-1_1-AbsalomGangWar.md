# Dead Suns 1.1: Absalom Gang War

## Introductions

The appointment date had arrived. Gareon and Tarea currently lived at Absalom Station, while Redacted, Cyscokt, and Nevos-4 arrived by starship from their prior homes and boarded the shuttle Okimoro for transport to the station. As the shuttle Okimoro loaded its passengers Gareon and Tarea received the confirmation of meeting time and place, Dock 94, on their infoPads. Gareon applied a disguise to avoid unwanted attention prior to departing for the dock. Each of the recruits had been provided the name, picture, and short description of Durovar Kreel as well as each other.

The brightly lit docks of Absalom Station were abuzz with activity as travelers bustled by, preparing to board or disembarking from starships bound to or from any of dozens of worlds. Brash and swaggering starpilots, scurrying ysoki mechanics, and expectant colonists mingled with enigmatic kasatha mystics, hard-faced asteroid miners, imposing vesk mercenaries, and more, creating a microcosm of the abundance and variety of life in the Pact Worlds. New arrivals met friends, loved ones, or business contacts, and were whisked away into the humming activity of daily life on the vast space station. Beyond them, ground crews tended to the docked ships, and dockworkers in mechanized cargo lifters loaded and unloaded freight and baggage. A sharp tang of ozone hung in the air — a byproduct of electrical discharges from the docked ships — but underneath, the station’s atmosphere had a slightly used aroma. The docking bay’s deck plates thrummed beneath their feet as the recruits assembled, making brief greetings while looking for their designated Starfinder representative, Durovar Kreel.

Redacted was the first to notice the tall and lanky dwarf with a bristly, iron-gray beard and deep-set eyes. With his patched and stained coveralls, Durovar looked like just another dockerworker, but a badge with the Starfinder Society crest stood out on his chest. He was busy checking the infoPad in his hand, but as the group waved to gain his attention, Taraea noticed two groups of three toughs on the fringes of the docking bay furtively taking up defensive positions among stacks of cargo crates and machinery. Before she could warn the other of her concerns, two events happened. Durovar looked up and spotting the recruits waved and smiled warmly, and then the two groups of thugs opened fire on each other.

## Caught in the Crossfire

Before any of the recruits could react, the air filled with laser blasts. Bystanders screamed and began to flee in terror or dive for cover. Kreel froze, paralyzed with fear, and then a laser beam struck him in the neck, and the dwarf fell to the deck and didn't move. Taking notice of Tarea, one of the thugs to the right of the recruits fired and struck her in the shoulder with his laser pistol. Infuriated Taraea summoned her solar armor as she drew her longsword and moved to cover. One of the thugs further ahead was severely wounded and caught on fire from a laser blast.

Recovering from their initial shock, the rest of the recruits sprung into action. Redacted dashed to cover, drawing her pistol and assessing the situation. Gareon recognized the thugs on the team's right side as Level-21 Crew gang members. Puzzled because this area was not their turf and the Level-21 Crew was not known for being particularly violent, he made a snap assessment that the other thugs must be something worse. Plus they had already fired on his teammates. Moving to cover, he shouted inspiration to his new teammates to focus on the thug that had shot Taraea. Nevos-4 was more than willing to comply. Moving to cover, he shouldered his autocannon and returned fire, hitting the thug in the leg. Taraea dashed toward the thug, taking cover at the abandoned vehicle. Disturbed by the wanton violence and concerned for Durovar's condition, Cyscokt started scrambling towards the fallen dwarf.

The gang members continued to trade laser fire. The one that was burning dropped to the ground, rolling and successfully smothering out the flames. The Level-21 Crew got another lucky hit on their enemies, setting a second gang member on fire. The crew didn't come out unscathed however, as their member who dashed across the dock to take cover behind a supply trailer was hit.

- The group discusses the event
	- Gareon and Redacted share their knowledge of the two gangs
- Very soon the security forces arrive.
	- security forces will confiscate the laser pistols but don't ask about credit sticks
	- Gareon realizes he will have to drop the disguise due to security identification process, but can play up family connections
	- reporter will be shortly behind the security forces and will want the scoop (this could be a recurring npc annoyance and possible help)
- After cleared to leave by the security forces, Gareon will guide the group to a cantina that he knows nearby to discuss what to do next
