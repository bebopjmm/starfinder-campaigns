### Abilities

#### Android

- **Constructed**: 
	- androids count as both humanoids and constructs (whichever effect is worse) for effects targeting creatures by type. 
	- +2 racial bonus to saving throws against disease, mind-affecting effects, poison, and sleep, unless those effects specifically target constructs. 
	- do not breathe or suffer the normal environmental effects of being in a vacuum.
- **Exceptional Vision**: low-light and darkvision 60 ft
- **Flat Effect**: -2 penalty to Sense Motive checks, +2 to DC of Sense Motive checks against them
- **Upgrade Slot**: single armor upgrade slot in their bodies. Regardless of whether androids are wearing physical armor, they can use this slot to install any one armor upgrade that could be installed into light armor.

#### Ace Pilot

- **Ace Pilot Knowledge**: Reduce the DC of Culture checks to recall knowledge about starship and vehicle models and parts as well as famous hotshot pilots by 5. Piloting is a class skill for you, though if it is a class skill from the class you take at 1st level, you instead gain a +1 bonus to your Piloting checks.

#### Soldier (Guard)

- **Armor Training**: reduce the armor check penalty of armor you wear by 1 (to a minimum of 0) and increase the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed by your armor by 1.

#### Feats

- **Toughness**: For every character level you have (and whenever you gain a new level), you gain 1 Stamina Point. In addition, you gain a +4 bonus to Constitution checks to continue running, to avoid damage from a forced march, to hold your breath, and to avoid damage from starvation or thirst. You also gain a +4 bonus to Fortitude saving throws to avoid taking damage from hot or cold environments, to withstand the harmful effects of thick and thin atmospheres, to avoid choking when breathing in heavy smoke, and to avoid fatigue caused by sleep deprivation.

## Background

Nevos-4 was 'born' at a foundry on Aballon, where it was immediately transitioned into military training. Upon certification as a soldier class android with piloting specialization, it decided against the traditional path of military or corporate security service. Instead Nevos-4 chose freelance for the greater independence and better opportunity to help eliminate the illegal manufacture and slavery of androids. 

The Starfinder Society's recent recruitment drive following the disasterous Scoured Stars incident caught Nevos-4's attention. It believes that by aligning with the Starfinder Society it will be able to do the most good towards protecting the Pact Worlds. The Exo-Guardian took interest in it's application, and Nevos-4 received a recruitment offer with starship passage to Absalom Station to meet Duravor Kreel.
