### Abilities

#### Racial 

- **Blindsense**: Shirrens’ sense vibrations in the air—out to 30 feet. A shirren ignores the Stealth bonuses from any form of visual camouflage, invisibility, and the like when attempting a Perception check opposed by a creature’s Stealth check. Even on a successful Perception check, any foe that can’t be seen still has total concealment (50% miss chance) against a shirren, and the shirren still has the normal miss chance when attacking foes that have concealment. A shirren is still flat-footed against attacks from creatures it can’t see.
- **Communalism**: Once per day, as long as an ally is within 10 feet, a shirren can roll a single attack roll or skill check twice and take the higher result.
- **Cultural Fascination**: +2 racial bonus to Culture and Diplomacy checks.
- **Limited Telepathy**: Shirrens can communicate telepathically with any creatures within 30 feet with whom they share a language. Conversing telepathically with multiple creatures simultaneously is just as difficult as listening to multiple people speak.

#### Spacefarer

- **Spacefarer Knowledge**: your knowledge of biology and topology to inure yourself to alien hazards. Reduce the DC of Physical Science checks to recall knowledge about strange new worlds or features of space by 5. Physical Science is a class skill for you, though if it is a class skill from the class you take at 1st level, you instead gain a +1 bonus to Physical Science checks.

#### Mystic

- **Healing Touch**: Once per day, you can spend 10 minutes to magically heal an ally up to 5 Hit Points per mystic level.
- **Star Shaman Connection**
	- **Walking the Void**: You are immune to the harmful environmental effects of outer space and vacuum. You also gain a fly speed of 20 feet while in space. In addition, whenever you can see the stars, you can determine your precise location.

#### Feats

- **Medical Expert**: You can use the Medicine skill in conjunction witha medpatch or sprayflesh to treat deadly wounds as a full action. When used in this way, the medpatch or sprayflesh does not perform any of its normal functions. You can also use the Medicine skill to provide long-term care with just a medkit.
