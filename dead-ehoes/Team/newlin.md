### Abilities

#### Racial

- **Skilled**: +1 skill rank at each level

#### Icon

- **Icon Knowledge**: You are hooked deeply into the culture of your iconic profession of corporate negotiator. When attempting a Profession or Culture check to recall knowledge about other icons of your profession or details about your profession’s cultural aspects, increase the DC by 5. You gain a +1 bonus to checks with your chosen Profession skill. Culture also becomes a class skill for you, though if it is a class skill from the class you take at 1st level, you instead gain a +1 bonus to Culture checks.  

#### Envoy

- **Envoy Improvisation (DC 13)**: little tricks that bolster allies, confound enemies, or change the ebb and flow of battle using guile, inspiration, or luck.
	- **Get 'Em (Ex)**: As a move action, you can choose one enemy within 60 feet. Until the start of your next turn, you and your allies gain a +1 morale bonus to attack rolls made against that enemy. The bonus persists even if the enemy moves beyond 60 feet or out of line of sight or hearing
- **Expertise**: +1d6 insight bonus to Sense Motive checks
- **Skill Expertise**: expertise insight bonus to Diplomacy checks

#### Feats

- **Diversion**: When you successfully use Bluff to create adistraction, you can allow an ally to attempt a Stealth check to hide (instead of attempting to hide yourself). You can attempt to allow multiple allies to use Stealth to hide, but you take a –5 penalty for every ally after the first, and on a failed check no ally can attempt to hide.
- **Weapon Focus (small arms)**: +1 attack bonus with small arms
