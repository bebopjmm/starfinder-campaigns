#### Icon

- **Icon Knowledge**: You are hooked deeply into the culture of your iconic profession of corporate negotiator. When attempting a Profession or Culture check to recall knowledge about other icons of your profession or details about your profession’s cultural aspects, increase the DC by 5. You gain a +1 bonus to checks with your chosen Profession skill. Culture also becomes a class skill for you, though if it is a class skill from the class you take at 1st level, you instead gain a +1 bonus to Culture checks.  

#### Envoy

- **Envoy Improvisation (DC 13)**: little tricks that bolster allies, confound enemies, or change the ebb and flow of battle using guile, inspiration, or luck.
	- **Inspiring Boost (5 Sta)**: As a standard action, you can signal an ally within 30 feet who has taken damage from any attack made by a significant enemy at any point after your last turn ended. That ally regains a number of Stamina Points (up to his maximum). Once an ally has benefited from your inspiring boost, that ally can’t gain the benefits of your inspiring boost again until he takes a 10-minute rest to recover Stamina Points.
