#### Operative (Hacker)

- **Operative Edge**: +1 Insight bonus to initiative and skill checks
- **Trick Attack (+1d4)**: As a full action, you can move up to your speed. Whether or not you moved, you can then make an attack with a melee weapon with the operative special property or with any small arm. Just before making your attack, attempt a Bluff, Intimidate, or Stealth check with a DC equal to 20 + your target’s CR. If you succeed at the check, you deal additional damage and the target is flat-footed. You can’t use this ability with a weapon that has the unwieldy special property or that requires a full action to make a single attack.
