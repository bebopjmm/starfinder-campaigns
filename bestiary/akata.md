## Abilities

- **Deaf (Ex)**: Akatas cannot attempt Perception checks to listen and are immune to effects that rely on hearing to function.
- **Hibernation (Ex)**: Akatas can enter a state of hibernation for an indefinite period of time when food is scarce. After 3 or more days without eating, an akata can secrete a fibrous material that hardens into a dense cocoon of the starmetal called noqual.
  - hardness 30 and 30 Hit Points, and immune to bludgeoning and fire damage.
  - As long as the cocoon remains intact, the akata within remains unharmed. The akata remains in a state of hibernation until it is exposed to extreme heat or senses a living creature with its blindsense, at which point it claws itself free of its cocoon in 1d4 minutes, leaving the fragments of its cocoon behind.
- **No Breath (Ex)**: Akatas don’t breathe and are immune to effects that require breathing.
- **Susceptible to Salt Water (Ex)**: A splash of salt water deals 1d6 damage to an akata, and full immersion in salt water deals 4d6 damage per round.
- **Void Bite (Ex)**: Akatas hold hundreds of microscopic larval young within their mouths, spreading their parasitic offspring to hosts through their bite. Only humanoids make suitable hosts for akata young—all other creature types are immune to this parasitic infection. This affliction is known as *Void Death* (disease-injury).
  - **Save**: Fortitude DC10
  - **Track**: Physical
  - **Frequency**: 1/day
  - **Effect**:  No latent/carrier state; an infected creature that dies rises as a void zombie 2d4 hours later.
  - **Cure**: 2 consecutive saves

## Description

Terrifying predators that dwell in the vast void of space, akatas make their homes on asteroids, comets, and dying planets, hibernating in cocoons for countless centuries. When a meteorite carrying an akata colony crashes onto a planet or another astronomical object that can support life, the akatas awake from their cocoons to seek out suitable hosts for their young. A typical akata stands 3-1/2 feet tall and weighs 400 pounds.

Akatas reproduce by implanting their parasitic larval offspring in humanoid hosts; this infection they cause, known as void death, functions as a disease and transforms its victims into undead void zombies.

The cocoon an akata can create around itself is composed primarily of the starmetal noqual. One bulk of noqual worth 500 credits can be harvested from the remnants of an akata cocoon.
