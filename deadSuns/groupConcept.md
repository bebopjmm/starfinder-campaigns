# Reboot of Personal Dead Suns Team

I'm rebooting my dead echoes team, having learned a fair bit about races, classes and themes. I also want to play test the campaign exactly as I I tend to run it for the Blizzard group.

1. start with Commencement adventure
2. Transition to Dead Suns Book 1 following Dock 94 attack

# Group Concept

Brought together as part of Starfinder Society recruiting drive.

- Tamai and Shero adventured together previously on Castrovel
- Renlih may have been the one to give Tamai the warning
- Nevos-352 mercenary team operation involved Mihyn
	- disagreement with team lead led Nevos-352 to break with the team?
