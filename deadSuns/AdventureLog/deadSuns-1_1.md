# Dead Suns Book 1: Incident at Absalom Station, Ch 1 - Absalom Gang War

A few days after completing their Commencement missions, the team receives a message from the Starfinder Society - Chiskisk has requested a meeting as soon as possible. Intrigued, the team heads for the Lorespire Complex.

## Meeting with Chiskisk

Upon their arrival, the team is greeted by the receptionist who points them toward a small waiting room and politely asks them to wait. After only a few minutes, a functionary arrives to lead them to a cluttered but clean office deep in the complex.

Chiskisk is seated behind a polished and unadorned plastic desk and wearing understated business clothes. The shirren is nervously flexing their antennae from side to side—a shirren expression of perplexity. Chiskisk welcomes them, offers refreshments (filtered water and processed-protein wafers), and bids everyone sit down.
> Chiskisk: “We received word that you have completed your commencement missions, and for that we congratulate you. We are afraid, however, that we must share some tragic news. You most likely heard reports of the shootout yesterday in the Arms at Dock 94. What has not yet been released publicly is the names of those killed. Duravor Kreel and two of the recruits that he was escorting were slain in the attack. The other two recruits are here in Lorespire Complex at the medical wing. We grieve especially for Duravor’s death. He was a valued member of the Society, and a friend. May the Lady of Graves be kind in her judgment of his soul.”

The shirren bows their head momentarily, then looks up, their compound eyes glittering.
> Chiskisk: "We had worked with Duravor for many years. He was a midranking member of the Starfinder Society and most of his work focused on mineral prospecting, but he also took an interest in mentoring new and prospective members of the Society. After his sister's tragic death a few year's back in a mining accident, the Starfinder Society became the closest thing he had left to family. Duravor will be greatly missed by many here. What puzzles us most is the reason behind this attack.”

Chisksik taps a few commands into their computer.
> Chiskisk: “According to the incident report released by station security, two gangs were involved in the attack: the Downside Kings and the Level 21 Crew. Gang wars are not uncommon on the station, but they usually confine themselves to the more lawless sectors of the Spire. It is rare for street gangs to battle openly in public areas like the docks. I cannot help but wonder whether all is as it seems. There must be a reason why those two gangs were at Docking Bay 94 at that time—the time of Duravor’s arrival, coincidentally. But was it coincidence? Was Duravor and his recruits just innocent bystanders caught in the crossfire, or might they have been specifically targeted? And if so, why?
> “We would like to ask you to investigate the incident on behalf of the Society. Find out exactly what happened and why. It may simply be a matter of being in the wrong place at the wrong time—We have no doubt station security will rule it so—but if Duravor was murdered, we would like to find justice for our friend.”

Getting over their initial shock,
> Renlih: "The Downside Kings are a brutal street gang that controls several decks of Absalom Station’s lower levels, or “Downside,” through a combination of intimidation and violence. They are known to engage in a wide variety of illegal activities, from extortion, fraud, robbery, smuggling, and theft, to drug and arms trafficking, kidnapping, murder-for- hire, and trafficking in sentient species.
The Level 21 Crew are a street gang that claims (unsurprisingly) Level 21 of Absalom Station’s seedy lower decks as its territory. Their known criminal endeavors include theft, fencing stolen goods, gambling, prostitution, racketeering, and smuggling. The Level 21 Crew may be a criminal gang, but they have a reputation in their territory (and neighboring levels) for promoting community empowerment, and many neighborhood residents tolerate or tacitly endorse their activities. The gang has also been known to hire itself out to defend marginalized and threatened groups or factions. Last I heard, a grizzled ysoki called Jabaxa currently leads the Level 21 Crew."
> Tamai: "Can we talk to the two recruits that survived the shootout?"
> Chiskisk: "Yes, that can be arranged. They may be able to recall some detail that could aid your investigation."
> Renlih: "What about Duravor's quarters? Can we check those out?"
> Chiskisk: "Hmm, Duravor had an apartment in the Drifter's End section. ASF currently has it secured, but the Starfinder Society should be able to get you access"

The team decides that talking with the shootout survivors should be the first step of their investigation.
