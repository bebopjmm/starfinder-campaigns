# Dead Suns Book 1: Incident at Absalom Station, Ch 1 - Absalom Gang War

A few days after completing their Commencement missions, the team receives a message from the Starfinder Society - Chiskisk has requested a meeting as soon as possible. Intrigued, the team heads for the Lorespire Complex.

## Meeting with Chiskisk

Upon their arrival, the team is greeted by the receptionist who points them toward a small waiting room and politely asks them to wait. After only a few minutes, a functionary arrives to lead them to a cluttered but clean office deep in the complex.

Chiskisk is seated behind a polished and unadorned plastic desk and wearing understated business clothes. The shirren is nervously flexing their antennae from side to side—a shirren expression of perplexity. Chiskisk welcomes them, offers refreshments (filtered water and processed-protein wafers), and bids everyone sit down.
> Chiskisk: “We received word that you have completed your commencement missions, and for that we congratulate you. We are afraid, however, that we must share some tragic news. You most likely heard reports of the shootout yesterday in the Arms at Dock 94. What has not yet been released publicly is the names of those killed. Duravor Kreel and two of the recruits that he was escorting were slain in the attack. The other two recruits are here in Lorespire Complex at the medical wing. We grieve especially for Duravor’s death. He was a valued member of the Society, and a friend. May the Lady of Graves be kind in her judgment of his soul.”

The shirren bows their head momentarily, then looks up, their compound eyes glittering.
> Chiskisk: "We had worked with Duravor for many years. He was a midranking member of the Starfinder Society and most of his work focused on mineral prospecting, but he also took an interest in mentoring new and prospective members of the Society. After his sister's tragic death a few year's back in a mining accident, the Starfinder Society became the closest thing he had left to family. Duravor will be greatly missed by many here. What puzzles us most is the reason behind this attack.”

Chisksik taps a few commands into their computer.
> Chiskisk: “According to the incident report released by station security, two gangs were involved in the attack: the Downside Kings and the Level 21 Crew. Gang wars are not uncommon on the station, but they usually confine themselves to the more lawless sectors of the Spire. It is rare for street gangs to battle openly in public areas like the docks. I cannot help but wonder whether all is as it seems. There must be a reason why those two gangs were at Docking Bay 94 at that time—the time of Duravor’s arrival, coincidentally. But was it coincidence? Was Duravor and his recruits just innocent bystanders caught in the crossfire, or might they have been specifically targeted? And if so, why?
> “We would like to ask you to investigate the incident on behalf of the Society. Find out exactly what happened and why. It may simply be a matter of being in the wrong place at the wrong time—We have no doubt station security will rule it so—but if Duravor was murdered, we would like to find justice for our friend.”

Getting over their initial shock,
> Renlih: "The Downside Kings are a brutal street gang that controls several decks of Absalom Station’s lower levels, or “Downside,” through a combination of intimidation and violence. They are known to engage in a wide variety of illegal activities, from extortion, fraud, robbery, smuggling, and theft, to drug and arms trafficking, kidnapping, murder-for- hire, and trafficking in sentient species.
The Level 21 Crew are a street gang that claims (unsurprisingly) Level 21 of Absalom Station’s seedy lower decks as its territory. Their known criminal endeavors include theft, fencing stolen goods, gambling, prostitution, racketeering, and smuggling. The Level 21 Crew may be a criminal gang, but they have a reputation in their territory (and neighboring levels) for promoting community empowerment, and many neighborhood residents tolerate or tacitly endorse their activities. The gang has also been known to hire itself out to defend marginalized and threatened groups or factions. Last I heard, a grizzled ysoki called Jabaxa currently leads the Level 21 Crew."
> Tamai: "Can we talk to the two recruits that survived the shootout?"
> Chiskisk: "Yes, that can be arranged. They may be able to recall some detail that could aid your investigation."
> Renlih: "What about Duravor's quarters? Can we check those out?"
> Chiskisk: "Hmm, Duravor had an apartment in the Drifter's End section. ASF currently has it secured, but the Starfinder Society should be able to get you access"

The team decides that talking with the shootout survivors should be the first step of their investigation.

## The Shootout Survivors

The Lorespire medics grant the team access to talk with Mustar, a kastatha male, and Kora, a human woman. Both are friendly, but apologetic that the doubt they have any useful information (tamai - 19 diplomacy).
- The team was caught in a crossfire between the two gangs.
	- Duravor was killed right at the start of the shootout; a laser blast to the neck.
	- Team returned fire, but two were gunned down fairly quickly
- Unclear which side actually shot Duravor.

Kora is clearly traumatized by the event and admits that she is considering dropping out of the program. Mustar is guilt-ridden that he couldn't do more. The team tries to reassure and encourage them.
- Shero (to Kora): the starfinder society is about knowledge, discovery, and exploration. there are so many important ways to contribute and make a difference
- Mihyn (to Kora): describes the *Master of Stars* and all the work needed to restore the society
- Nevos-352 (to Mustar): you were thrust into a bad situation, yet you managed to prevent Kora from being killed. Do not dismiss that achievement so lightly
- Renlih (to both): we will find out the reason for those thugs being at the dock, and justice will be dealt
- Tamai (to both): Duravor believed in the both of you. The best way to honor his memory is to see this through. The society needs people just like you.

After talking to Mustar and Kora, the team grabs some lunch. Not long after they finish, they receive a message from ASF indicating that two detectives, Isabel Calasanz and Solagi-432, will be able to meet them at Duravor's apartment in one hour.

## Duravor's Apartment

Isabel and Solagi-432 let the team into the apartment, which is extremely unkempt.
- detectives make is clear that they believe nothing will come of this

Mihyn goes to the computer terminal
- (Computers 23): easily gets into Duravor's personal files
- (Computers 25): assembles collection of info describing his activities outside the Starfinder Society including:
  - Kreel was a native of the Diaspora, the diffuse asteroid belt between Verces and Eox, and was known to have ties to dwarves and other mining groups in the region. An outspoken champion of miners’ rights, Kreel was active in challenging large corporate interests that exploited individual miners and laborers, including Astral Extractions.
  - Kreel had personally invested money in the Hardscrabble Collective. In addition, his sister was a member of the group, but she died in a mining accident—the result of safety violations perpetrated by her contract employer, Astral Extractions.

**Hardscrabble Collective**
- Mihyn (5 Culture): not familiar with HC
- Tamia (9 Culture): not familiar with HC
- Renlih (22 Culture)
  - The Hardscrabble Collective is a clan of stubborn asteroid miners that operates primarily among the scattered planetoids of the Diaspora. It has no offices or base of operations, but the clan members usually view the Armada—the ever-changing  fleet of ships that orbit Absalom Station—as a central gathering place. Collective crews hire their ships out to a wide variety of business concerns, including Astral Extractions, which recently employed the Collective ship *Acreon* to scout for new mining prospects in the Vast.
  - While the Hardscrabble Collective calls itself a clan, it is more of a cooperative business enterprise, a coalition of dozens of ships’ crews who have banded together for mutual bene t and safety. While some of the Collective’s members are related, most of them are individuals from a dozen different races: humans, dwarves, androids, ysoki, and more. Nevertheless, the Hardscrabble Collective is as tightly knit as many families, and members  fiercely look after one another’s welfare.

**Astral Extractions**
- Mihyn (20 Culture)
  - Astral Extractions is a powerful mining conglomerate with business ties throughout the Pact Worlds. Most of the company’s operations are centered in the Diaspora and the rocky moons of the outer planets, but it has also begun sending scout vessels into the Vast in search of new claims. The company recently hired one of the Hardscrabble Collective’s ships, the *Acreon*, for one of these exploratory missions.
- Tamai (25 Culture)
  - The public face of Astral Extractions is that of an ethical and respectable corporation, but outside of the public eye, some say the company uses hired muscle—corporate mercenaries, strikebreakers, and even criminal elements—as proxies to intimidate and threaten those who stand in its way.
- Renlih (27 Culture): backs up Tamai's assessment. If Duravor really annoyed AE it wouldn't be out of character for AE to threaten and intimidate him, but a hit seems too high risk

Nevos-352 and Shero search through belongings
- Nevos-352(14 Perception): apparent that Durovor subsisted on beer and cheap take-out food
- Shero(25 Perception):
