# Dead Suns Book 0: Commencement, Ch 4 - The Exo-Guardians Mission

## Mission Brief

The team uses the contact info provided by Guidance to contact Zigvigix. The shirren instructs them to meet him at an art park in the Downlow district. Garbage litters the ground around the district’s largest art park—a cement lot filled with undulating metal sculptures and covered in graffiti of grotesquely adorable creatures. The sounds of music and chatter drift over from the nearby clubs, chronically interrupted by the roar of the local gangsters’ engines. A heavily augmented male shirren is sitting on one of the park benches, eating a simple meal of cold grub-noodles and rice candy. His antennae perk up at the tremor of approaching footsteps.
> Zigvigix (telepathically): “Welcome, new Starfinders! And congratulations! My speech-name is Zigvigix, but feel free to call me Ziggy, if that would be easier for you. Have some rice candy to celebrate your graduation! Today is your big day! When you are ready, I have two assignments I could use assistance with. The first is to help me secure a new headquarters on Absalom Station. I’ve been in talks with our station’s protectors, the Stewards, and they were kind enough to give us ownership of a warehouse here in Downlow for that purpose! The current owners no longer want it because a vicious alien took it over and kills anyone who goes inside. Once the alien is gone and the warehouse cargo has been returned to its owners, we can start installing desks and computers, so please go in and incinerate the creature!

Zigvigix twitches their tooth barbs for a moment and then holds out a credstick.
> “My second assignment… Please buy the brand-new Strawberry Machine Cake album, *Star Sugar Heartlove!!!*, which comes out tomorrow, and give it to Historia-7 when you see her. I wish to do it myself, but I… I have trouble standing for long periods of time. Thank you very much!”

### Follow-up Questions

Tamai asks if there is any details about this 'vicious alien' that has taken over the warehouse. After tapping on his datapad, Zigvix transfer some data to the team.
> Zigvigix: As far as the Stewards have been able to piece together, a two-bit crime lord illegally imported the creature, and the beast promptly ate him. Here are the holorecordings of the incident taken off the station’s security cameras. After reviewing them, I believe that the creature is a feather stalker, a predator far more unpleasant than its name implies.

Nevos-352, somewhat confused, asks if he heard the second assignment correctly
> Zigvigix: Historia-7 has seemed down after losing her mentor in the Scoured Stars. I hope the sugar-pop music can cheer up the android; their music always makes me feel better. Electric Shock always lifts me up, and who can resist the groove of Scream. Ah, I wish that I could be there to hear the newest releases.

## Shopping
Before tackling the warehouse, the team decides to get some additional gear, particularly healing serums. The Freemarkets has everything that they need.
- Mihyn: 2 mk1b healing serums
- Nevos-352: 2 mk1b healing serums
- Renlih: 2 mk1b healing serums
- Tamai: 2 mk1b healing serums

The plan for the next day is to get the stupid album and then clear out the warehouse.

## Strawberry Machine Cake
The line is **INSANE**. It takes 6 hours before the team gets to where they can buy the album, with Strawberry Machine Cake songs blasting the entire time.
- no one suffers fatigue from standing in line
- Renlih takes 3 bludgeoning dmg, Shero take 1 dmg from the exuberant crowd

Head to Lorespire Complex to deliver the album.

### Delivery to Historia-7
Historia-7 welcomes the team again asking how she may help them. When they hand over the music album, she gives them a long, unreadable stare before calmly stating she will enter it into the archives. As they depart, Renlih (21 Perception) and Shero (16 Perception) both hear H-7 quietly humming one of the Strawberry Machine Cake songs.

Thankful that task is over the team proceeds to the warehouse.

## Abandoned Warehouse
Dim light hinders Tamai and Shero, but not the others.
- checking SE crates, Shero finds a battery
- Shero later finds a flashlight that she uses
- Tamai finds a flare
- Renlih also finds a flashlight that he gives to Tamai

Report success to Stewards outside the warehouse. A contingent of station security moves into the warehouse to start removing cargo and freeing up the space for the Exo-Guardians. As this occurs, Zigvigix emerges from behind the cordon line to congratulate the team on a successful extermination.

## Mission Outcome

Zigvigix congratulates the team on a successful extermination, and upon hearing that they delivered that album praises the team and commends them for their strong team spirit. He transfers 400cr to each of the team and hands over 2 mk1 incendiary grenades.
> Ziggy: Have fun with the grenades, but don’t blow yourselves up, I like you!

Worn out from the day, the team heads back home for a good meal, drinks and sleep.
