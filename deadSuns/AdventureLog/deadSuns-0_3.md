# Dead Suns Book 0: Commencement, Ch 3 - The Acquisitives Mission

## Meeting with Radaszam
The team tracks down the location of the Acquisitives public-facing office in the Nyori Palisades, a luxurious neighborhood located in Absalom Station’s transparent central dome. After a short wait, they are escorted to Radaszam's office. The chamber is bleak and expressionless in its emptiness—no vanities line its smooth black walls, and no signs of use mar its smooth black furniture. The only occupants of the suite are a bug-eyed tadpole wriggling in a glowing blue aquarium and a reptilian vesk seated behind an onyx desk. The vesk gestures to a number of chairs in front of him, his features sharply illuminated by the light of his desk’s green holoscreen.
> Radaszam, in a low pleasant voice: "The new graduates, Good day. I am Radaszam, though since you are here, I  should hope you already knew. I trust you are aware of our Society’s traditions, so I will cut to the point. I have a minor situation that needs resolution. One of our members, a human named Laboni, had a rather public altercation with a junk scavenger from the Spike. You might be more familiar with the scavenger than I, actually; he is a ysoki who fancifully calls himself Ratrod. I am told he runs a popular racing competition that has, hmm, several hundreds of thousands of viewers on the station’s infosphere."

- (Mihyn: 6 Culture): very familiar with junk racing. There is a lot of buzz and excitement about the upcoming junkrace.  Apparently some nobody mouthed off to Ratrod, the reigning junkrace champion. People know that trash talking really gets under Ratrod’s fur and wonder whether there will be more harsh words exchanged before the race.
- (Renlih: 19 Culture): the ysoki-dominated Salvage Union controls most of the yards in Botscrap where junkracing occurs.

> Radaszam: "For some reason, Laboni felt the need to tell him that any ‘real’ mechanic could easily beat the garbage that Ratrod and his associates slap together. Now that Ratrod has issued an infosphere-wide demand that she race him and  prove it, Laboni doubts she can back that claim up. Embarrassing, isn’t it? Not really the sort of troublemaker that suits our Society. Perhaps she would be better suited to the bottom of a trash compactor… Well, we cannot afford to throw her out, not after so many Starfinders were lost in the Scoured Stars. Besides, we can’t let people think we are so weak that we can’t control our own members, or that we cannot stand up to a scrapyard junker. No, I would like you to assist Laboni in winning this race. Show our detractors that even the least of our Society is not someone to be trifled with.”

Team takes the pit crew badges and directions and heads for the racing site.
- Mihyn is super excited by this mission

## Ratrod's Scrap Battle
Arrivng at the race site, the bot at the entrance scans their badges, explains the race rules, and directs them to the prep area. Finding Laboni was no problem.
> Laboni: “Radaszam sent you? Oh thank the stars, I’m so glad you’re here. Look, I’m real sorry about this whole mess. Ratrod is a loudmouth jerk. Most of the other racers can’t stand him, and I was repeating some of their opinions trying to fit in you know when he overheard me and well, everything just got out of hand and carried away. Truth be told my racer is in no shape to compete, and we don’t have a lot of time, but there’s a ton of useful stuff to scavenge and upgrade it before the race."

Basic Plan:
- Mihyn will concentrate on scavenging and upgrading Laboni's junkracer.
- Nevos-352 is really out of his element, but will attempt to aid Mihyn as best he can
- Shero will aid in scavenging
- Tamai will focus on getting to know the other racers
- Renlih will start by investigating the other racers to aid Tamai
-

- Shero (Perception 22) scavenges equipment to improve the junkracer's EAC +2
- Renlih (Sense Motive 16) investigates all the other racers besides Ratrod
  - Lemgem: decent pilot, but could be convinced to do something stupid to her racer. Also candidate for alliance
  - Nvizin: decent pilot but good shooter. Aloof - something going on with her
  - Orsis: good pilot. A bit vain but overall decent individual
  - Velocity: very good pilot, but subpar mechanic. alliance potential here

### Prep Round 2
- Mihyn (Computers 21) scavenges equipment to improve the junkracer's speed by 5ft
- Nevos-352 (Perception 16) aids Shero
- Shero (Perception 20) scavenges equipment to upgrade the energy weapon
- Renlih socializes with Ratrod (Sense Motive 23, Diplomacy 23) realizes the ysoki is deeply offended at the challenge to his legitimacy and that a direct apology from Laboni would go a long way to easing the bad blood
- Tamai socializes with Velocity (Diplomacy 20) and gets an alliance that if they improve her junkracer's speed, she will position herself to into second place and directs her weapons against anyone in front of Laboni’s junkracer

### Prep Round 3
- Mihyn (Physical Science 16) scavenges equipment to improve Velocity's racer, alliance secured
- Nevos-352 and Shero, working together to scavenge equipment and improve the junkracer's EAC +2
- Renlih (Computers 12) has no success scavenging
- Tamai (Diplomacy 23) socializes with Lemgem and secures an alliance
  - Lemgem warns them about Ratrod’s energy absorption ability and agrees to take second place and does her best to weaken the position of racers ahead of Laboni’s vehicle.

### Prep Round 4
- Mihyn (Physical Science 13) fails to scavenge anything useful
- Nevos-352 and Shero, working together scavenge equipment to improve the junkracer speed
- Renlih (Intimidate 17) forces Laboni to go over a apologize to Ratrod
- Tamai (Diplomacy 25) befriends Orsis who provides tips that can be used while remotely controlling Laboni’s vehicle, granting a +2 insight bonus to Piloting checks

## Mission Outcome

After the race, Laboni and Ratrod shake hands. The ysoki's pride is still hurt, but she has proven herself. Another ysoki, a representative of the Salvage Union, comes to congratulate Laboni and Lemgem. He encourages Laboni to become a regular on Ratrod's show and provides his electronic business card both her and the team.

The team returns to the Nyori Palisades to report their results to Radaszam. He is vaguely amused by the results and definitely pleased to have contacts with the Salvage Union.

As it is only mid-afternoon, the team decides to track down the Exo-Guardian faction leader, Zigvigix, in the Downlow.
