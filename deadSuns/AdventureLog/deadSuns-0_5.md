# Dead Suns Book 0: Commencement, Ch 5 - The Wayfinders Mission

The next morning, a courier bot delivered a package to the team from Birsen Taylan (Ceren). Inside is a note of thanks for everything that they did, and datajack. They stored it as part of their 'armory' for the time being and head to the dock to take a shuttle out to the *Master of Stars*.

## Mission Brief
The station’s Armada can be seen from the shuttle’s view screen as it takes off, gleaming figures standing out against the emptiness of space. The *Master of Stars* immediately stands out from the rest, as layers and layers of scaffolding obscure its hull. Tiny lights flicker among the metal beams as distant figures weld plates and heat shields to the ship’s exterior. The shuttle smoothly glides closer until it reaches the starship’s docking bay, slipping through the magic field that keeps the hold pressurized with breathable atmosphere. As the shuttle doors open, a small drone flies in and pops up a holoscreen, displaying a harried-looking ratfolk.
> Fisk (sounding pleased): “Finally, fresh meat! Name’s Fitch—pleasantries over, time to get to work. I had some trouble earlier with the lights flickering on the ship, and now both the lights and computers have suddenly gone out on E-Deck. No idea what’s causing it, but you work this job long enough and—”

Fitch’s attention flicks to something offscreen,
> Fitch (shouting): “Kirkath! The welding torch is not a toy! You wanna go in the toddler’s pen with the other kids?”

She snorts dismissively before continuing,
> Fitch: “Sorry, some of these little ones would cut off their own heads if I let them. Anyway, it could be some lunkhead screwed up the wiring, but that’s a pretty big system failure for a simple electrical short. I’d prefer to send in some people with combat training to scout it out, just in case someone or something is sabotaging the ship. If it’s nothing, great, get the power back on if you can. If there’s something suspicious, use your comm units to report in to me. I’ll give you the access codes, so— Selicha! If you touch that panel I will staple you to the hull!”

The screen on the drone cuts out, then flashes to display the ship’s schematics and the passwords for the computers on E-Deck. The team takes the working lifts and maintenance tunnels to reach E-Deck. The doors on E-Deck are closed and do not automatically open without power, but since the magnetic seals on the doors are also disabled due to the power loss, the manages to force their way through.

## E-Deck
The E-Deck is in total darkness when the team arrives, making the first order of business to restore power to the lights and the cameras prior to entering the area.
- Mihyn(Engineering 10) was unable to get power restored mechanically
- Mihyn(Computers 18) was able to tap into the network and reroute power flows, restoring lights and cameras to the deck

Using the access codes the team can display camera views to their comms and datapads.
- easily see two children scurrying around a storage room.

### The Empty Storage Room

Making their way to the storage room, the team opens the door to see scattered barrels and boxes line the lowered floor of this storage chamber. A thick bulkhead to the port side leads farther onto the deck, while a similar bulkhead to the aft connects to an arterial hallway that runs the length of the deck. The children are obviously hiding, so Tamai attempts to coax them out,
> Tamai (displaying his Starfinder Society Implant): Hello? We are Starfinders. Everything is okay and its safe to come out

Kieu Lan and Kieu Si emerge in near hysterics, alternating between relief at having been found and panic that they are going to be in trouble. The team attempts to comfort and calm the children
- Renlih (nat 1 Diplomacy) makes the situation worse, "I'm not that good with children"
- Tamai (17 Diplomacy) overcomes the challenge and gets them calm enough to tell their story
- Shero (13 Sense Motive) picks up that they are hiding information
- Tamai (25 Diplomacy) convinces them to reveal the trap that they set

Decide its time to contact Fitch with an update,
- Fitch is quite curious about this escaped alien and asks them to make first contact before circumstances get out of hand. Only resort to violence as a last resort. She will have the children's father come retrieve them.

Kieu Kein arrives about 30 minutes later, exasperated that his children snuck off from their designated area, but greatly relieved that they are okay.
- Shero promises the children before they depart that their alien friend will not be harmed.

### Tracking the Alien
The storage room west door opens into two adjoining chambers. The immediately noticeable thing is how frigidly cold the area is and that ice has formed along the floors making them extremely slippery.
- Renlih barely maintains his balance when he enters
- Tamai manages just fine

Moving cautiously over the slippery floors the team investigates. It is apparent that the alien is capable of chewing through the interior walls of the ship.
- Mihyn (20 Engineering) is able to correlate power loss progression with the likely path of the creature
- Renlih takes off armor and assumes natural form to better follow the holes. Shero casts *Life Bubble* on him to protect from the frigid cold
  - (15 Acrobatics) take 4 slash Dmg
  - (19 Acrobatics) tracks down creature at a system broken by the alien blindly meddling with controls it did not understand
- Team converges in southern chamber as the creature, startled by Renlih's appearance chews through the wall into that chamber.

Team attempts to be non-threatening (no drawn weapons) but unsure how to best communicate (all fail sense motive).
- Shero (25 Life Science) suspects the creature is hungry and has possibly been feeding on the ship power systems
- Mihyn (25 Engineering) successfully tests the theory with a small electrical device, but the creature is still apparently hungry
- Shero (20 Medicine) recommends giving it a battery to consume

The creature eagerly consumes the full battery charge and passes out. Reporting their success to Fitch, she sends someone down with a cage that should keep the creature safe and secure. The team is instructed to report to the bridge.

## Mission Debrief
With the alien gone, engineers can move back into E-Deck and fix the damage done. Fitch turns the alien over to an assembled team of experts in hopes of learning more of the alien’s language and culture.
> Fitch: You did well, I'm impress. The alien will be turned over to a team of experts in hopes of learning more of it's language an culture. Here's something for your efforts.

She then gives them a credstick with 1500cr on it (300 apiece). With all their missions complete, the team needs to report back to Guidance.

# Guidance
Back at the Lorespire Complex, the intelligence once again presents itself in a holographic form—this time taking on the appearance of a wizened male korasha lashunta— to congratulate the team on their successful missions. It goes on to state that in the aftermath of the Scoured Stars incident, the Society needs skilled agents more than ever, and that it sees potential in the PCs as they start their new careers as Starfinder field agents.

**All PCs Advance to Level 2**
