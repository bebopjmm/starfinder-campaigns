# Dead Suns Book 0: Commencement, Ch 2 - The Dataphiles Mission

## Mission Brief with Historia-7

Team has no difficulty finding the Archives' Cortex where Historia-7 maintains an office. She briefs them on the Bluerise Tower break-in.
- Tamai (14 Culture check): Bluerise Tower is a private office structure in the Ring maintained by multiple corporations that have arranged for nearly complete sovereignty over the tower levels they own, with even the Stewards having a difficult time obtaining permission to enter.
- Renlih (18 Culture check): tower residents rumored to be living in a self-described anarcho-capitalist utopia. If any tenants disagree, their complaints have never made it past their employers’ private security.

Shero asks why the corporations require and are allowed to have such absolute sovereignty?
- H-7: that is a question of great interest to many people, including myself. I believe these corporations know much more than they let on, and the Society needs to stay informed, particularly in its current vulnerable state.

Tamai says that team will accept the mission, and H-7 transmits an address to a flat in Drifter's End.
- the team is well aware that this district surrounds the Lorespire Complex and earns its name by catering to alien ambassadors from newly discovered worlds, explorers, long-haul cargo crews, and spacefaring vagabonds of all sorts. Housing is cheap and temporary, bars are noisy and full of stories.
- Renlih (18 Culture check): patrons looking to hire experienced scouts and first-contact specialists clog notorious “Drifter” hangouts such as the Hard Burn, Kristoff’s, and the Last Good Run. Duravor’s favorite hangout, the Paralax Cantina, is also in the district.
  - H-7 reminds them that speed is critical and that a pub crawl will have to wait

Team departs to the address provided

## Investigating Drifter's End

The team locates the address without issue. Seeing the young man hand-pollinating plants, Tamai recommends he and Renlih approach, while the others keep an eye out from a distance. Tamai and Renlih approach and greet the young man.
- Tamai introduces themselves and young man responds with his name, Jubair
- Tamai questions if he has been to the Bluerise Tower recently
  - Jubair is confused: "No, why would I go there? What is this all about?"
- Renlih is more stern: "There was an incident there two days ago, an incident linked to you. It's in your best interest to be forthcoming with us"
  - Jubair is scared now: "I don't know what you're talking about. I've never been to the tower and have nothing to do with whatever you're talking about. please go away and leave me alone"
    - Renlih (Sense Motive 11) tells Tamai that the kid seems to be telling the truth

At this point, Ceren comes out and asks what the trouble is. Jubair tells her about the strange accusations. Tamai (Diplomacy 13) activates his Starfinder emblem and explains they are following a lead on the incident.
> Ceren: Well that is quite extraordinary, but I can't see how we have anything to do with it. Why we all go inside and have a cup of tea and sort this out. You're associates over there are quite welcome to join us.

 - Renlih (Sense Motive 22) realizes Ceren seems oddly uncertain despite her tone

 Tamai signals to the others and everyone goes inside. While making the tea, Ceren asks that they explain why the Starfinder Society has sent them to her home. Renlih nods when Tamai glances his way, and Tamai explains the nature of their inquiry.
 - Ceren discovers the stolen files within her memory banks
 - Ceren explains her background and current situations

Ceren makes the proposal that the team help her fake her death and place Jubair under Society protection. She is quite happy to give the files over to the society in exchange for their aid.

### The Plan

1. Nevos-352 and Shero will stay to help Ceren and Jubair pack. Then they will escort Jubair to the Lorespire Complex to ensure his safety.
  - Ceren has a couple of other arrangements to finalize
2. Tamai, Mihyn, and Renlih will deal with faking Ceren's death
  - Renlih will pose as Jubair and claim that an unidentified body is Ceren
  - Mihyn will forge new identity papers
  - Tamai will line up some new contacts
3. Team will regroup and meet Ceren at Jutambe Park at the designated time

## In Memoriam

- it take 4hrs to find a mortician with a suitable unidentified body
- while hunting for a suitable body, Tamai makes a series of calls and lines up a few helpful contacts for Ceren
- while hunting for a suitable body, Mihyn gets new identification forged for the alias that Renlih and Tamai concoct
- at the mortician, Renlih successfully bluffs the morician when identifying the body as Ceren

Nevos-352 and Shero escort Jubair to the Lorespire Complex and transfer him protective custody without incident.

### Pass/Fail
- Pass: Renlih Disguse check to pass as Jubair
- Pass: Tamai Diplomacy check to provide Ceren with contacts in her new life
- Pass: Mihyn Computers check to forge new identification (Birsen Taylan)
- Pass: Renlih Bluff check to claim an unidentified body is Ceren
- Pass: Renlih and Tamai Culture check to concoct a new alias

## Jatambe Park

The team regroups at the designated time and goes to Jatambe Park, finding the bridge where Ceren awaits them. As they approach the bridge, four armed corporate thugs also approach from the opposite side of the bridge with weapons drawn.
> Agent-1: You citizens need to clear the area. This woman is a wanted entity. You will not get a second warning
> Tamai: That woman won't be going anywhere with you assholes

### Round 1
- the agents move onto the bridge and ready their pulsecaster pistols to fire at anyone who approaches
- Renlih advances to bridge and trick attacks agent-1 (7dmg)
- agents 1 and 3 fire and hit Renlih with pulsecasters (5dmg)
- Mihyn moves to take a shot at agent 1 but misses
- Nevos-352 moves to protect Ceren
- agents 2 and 4 fire at Nevos-352 but only agent-2 hits (4dmg)
- Shero advances and hurls telekinetic projectile at agent-1 but misses
- Tamai activates his solar weapon and advances (photon attuned)
- Ceren falls back beside Mihyn

### Round 2
- Renlih trick attacks agent-1 again (4dmg)
- agent-1 retreats but agent 3 hits Renlih again with pulsecaster (2dmg)
- Mihyn holds until Nevos-352 and Tamai
- Nevos-352 fires at agent-2 (4dmg) and falls back to protect Ceren
- agents 2 and 4 fire at Tamai, both hitting (4dmg)
- Shero obliterates agent-3's mind with mind thrust (16dmg)
- Tamai engages agent-2, slashing him badly (8dmg)
- Mihyn moves into firing position and hits agent-2, rendering him unconscious

### Round 3
- Renlih orders the last remaining agent to drop his weapon and surrender and the agent does (Intimdate 25)

### Developments
Renlih takes the weapons of the agents while Tamai questions them (who hired you? what was your assignment?)
- agents are part of a merc unit called The Surge Squad
- bounty mission was capture (target was Ceren) and delivery to Bluerise Tower, brokered through anonymous third party system
- Renlih has an account with that system and verifies the bounty

Nevos-352 warns that Absalom Security Forces are sure to respond to the gunfight.
- team lets mercs leave, carrying their dead comrade
> Tamai: You can consider this bounty voided.
> Agents: You crossed the wrong people today. This isn't over.

Ceren on an adrenaline high ('just like the old days')
- unperturbed by the agents’ appearance, confident that the PCs’ work at falsifying her death should throw off future investigations into her whereabouts
- team provided her new identity and she turns over the data files
- she will send Starfinder Society and arrange a meeting to take custody of Jubair soon

## Mission Outcome

Historia-7 meets the team as soon as they arrive at the Lorespire Complex.
- they turn over the files
- impressed with the job they did, unfortunate that an agent was killed, but that happens. No issue with ASF.
- Ceren has been in contact and expressed her gratitude, promising to aid the society
- H-7 transfers 200cr to each member of the team
