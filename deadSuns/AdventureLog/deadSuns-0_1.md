# Dead Suns Book 0: Commencement, Ch 1 - Graduation 

The team is assembled at their graduation ceremony, held in the Lorespire Complex. Following a brief commencement speech from First Seeker Luwazi Elsebo, each member of the team is presented a Starfinder emblem by their senior evaluator, Chiskisk, a host shirren. Following the ceremony they proceed to a small reception.
- Chiskisk and Duravor Kreel congratulate the team and socialize on current events
  - gossip of the day is the mysterious arrival of the starship *Acreon* towing some asteroid but missing its crew
    - Kreel mentions that it is a Hardscrabble ship and that he needs to look into the situation
  	- Kreel promises to take team out for celebratory drinks at Paralax Cantina once they complete their commencement assignments

Shortly after Duravor departs, Chiskisk's comms beeps, indicating that it is time to escort the team to their meeting with Guidance.
- along the way, they share that Kreel has ties with the Hardscrabble Collective
- also mentions that the Starfinder Society has covered a week's rent for the team at the Moons of Sleep

## Guidance

As the doors to the Lorespire Complex slid open, a green holographic image of a middle-aged human woman shimmered into view at the center of the room.
> “Greetings, I am Guidance. Please use the cheek swabs in the open receptacle to provide a genetic sample for Starfinder Society identification purposes. If desired, you may place your hand on the glowing panel to receive a subdermal implant further marking you as a member of the Society.”

Each team member submits to receiving the subdermal implant, and Guidance continues.
> "It is our pleasure to officially welcome you into the Starfinder Society. Today is the commencement of your new role as a Starfinder field agent. It is our tradition, at the end of the graduation ceremony, for new graduates to present themselves to the heads of our most prominent factions and complete a task at those leaders’ behest. This allows the leaders of these groups to become familiar with all new Starfinder agents, and it provides a constant supply of agents for handling situations in our holdings on Absalom Station. While these tasks were formerly symbolic, the heavy loss of Starfinder agents in the Scoured Stars necessitates that these missions become something more. Please treat any tasks given with the gravity you would grant any other Starfinder assignment.”

Guidance transmits a datafile with a summary of the factions to the team.

> "Once you have completed a faction leader's mission, they will report the results to me. Once you have completed all the missions, you should return to the Lorespire Complex to finish your commencement and prepare for future missions."

Departing, the team looks over their mission assignments.
- Tamai notes that the Dataphiles point of contact is right here in the Lorespire Complex
- Everyone agrees that is seems logical to start with meeting Historia-7, leader of the Dataphiles faction
