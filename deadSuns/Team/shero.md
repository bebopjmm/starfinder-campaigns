## Abilities

### Racial

- **Lashunta Magic**: Lashuntas gain the following spell-like abilities:
	- **At will**: daze (DC11), psychokinetic hand
	- **1/day**: detect thoughts (DC12)
- **Limited Telepathy**: Lashuntas can mentally communicate with any creatures within 30 feet with whom they share a language. Conversing telepathically with multiple creatures simultaneously is just as difficult as listening to multiple people speaking.

### Priest (The Green Faith)

- **Theme Knowledge**:
  - Reduce the DC of Culture and Mysticism checks to recall knowledge about religious traditions, religious symbols, and famous religious leaders by 5.
  - +1 theme bonus to Mysticism checks.

### Mystic (Xenodruid)

- **Healing Touch (5hp)**: Once per day, Shero can spend 10 minutes to magically heal an ally up to 5hp per mystic level.
- **Xenodruid Connection**
  - **Speak With Animals**: Shero can communicate with any creature of the animal type, though this doesnâ€™t make it friendly.
    - If an animal is friendly toward her, it may do her favors
    - Shero can use Intimidate to bully animals, and can use any other language-dependent effect against animals.
