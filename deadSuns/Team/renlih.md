*Glamered Fusion*: As a standard action, a weapon with the glamered fusion can be commanded to change its appearance to assume the form of another object of similar size. The weapon retains all its properties (including bulk) when disguised but does not radiate magic. Only true seeing or similar magic reveals the true nature of a glamered weapon while it is in disguise. After a glamered weapon is used to make an attack, this fusion is suppressed for 1 minute.

## Abilities

### Racial

- **Change Form**: As a standard action, Renlih can physically alter their form to look like any Medium creature, as long as they have seen a similar creature before.
  - they can mimic either a specific creature or a general creature of the choosen type
  - +10 bonus to Disguise checks to appear as a creature of the type and subtype of the new form
  - DC of a Disguise check is not modified as a result of altering major feature or if they disguise themselves as an aberration or a humanoid (though the DC is still modified if the astrazoan attempts to disguise themselves as a different creature type)
  - Renlih can remain in an alternate form indefinitely (or until they take another form)
- **Compression**: Renlih can move through an area as small as 1/4 their space without squeezing or 1/8 their space when squeezing.
- **Darkvision**: Renlih can see up to 60 feet in the dark.
- **Many Forms**: For effects targeting creatures by type, astrazoans count as both aberrations and humanoids.
- **Rapid Revival**: Once per day, when an astrazoan takes a 10-minute rest to regain Stamina Points, they can additionally recover Hit Points as though they had taken a full night’s rest.

### Bounty Hunter

- **Theme Knowledge**: Renlih's mind is a cold steel trap when it comes to scraps of information about the creatures they're tracking down. Choose a specific sentient creature that can be identify by name, alias, or specific identity to be Renlih's mark.
  - Reduce the DC of Culture or Profession (bounty hunter) checks to recall knowledge about your mark, as well as to recall knowledge about law-enforcement individuals and practices, by 5.
  - If the mark is known only by an alias or secret identity, this ability helps Renlih learn facts only about the identity known, not any other unknown identities.
  - Once a mark is defeated, as an action that takes 1 minute, Renlih can study dossiers and database information about another individual to be their new mark. You can instead abandon your mark for a new one without defeating it, but if you do so, you take a –2 penalty to all skill checks for 1 week.
  - +1 bonus to Survival checks.

### Operative (Detective)

- **Operative Edge (+1)**: insight bonus to initiative and skill checks
- **Trick Attack (+1d4)**: As a full action, you can move up to your speed. Whether or not you moved, you can then make an attack with a melee weapon with the operative special property or with any small arm. Just before making your attack, attempt a Bluff, Intimidate, or Stealth check with a DC equal to 20 + your target’s CR. If you succeed at the check, you deal additional damage and the target is flat-footed. You can’t use this ability with a weapon that has the unwieldy special property or that requires a full action to make a single attack.
	- Renlih can attempt a Sense Motive check with a +4 bonus to make a trick attack by reading your foe.
- **Specialization Skills (Skill Focus,Free Skill Rank)**: Culture, Sense Motive
- **Evasion**: If Renlih succeeds at a Reflex save against an effect that normally has a partial effect on a successful save, he instead suffers no effect. He gains this benefit only when unencumbered and wearing light armor or no armor, and he loses the benefit when he is helpless or otherwise unable to move.
- **Operative Exploits**
  - **Inoculation(+1)**: Renlih trained to resist various chemical and biological weapons, toxins, and pathogens he come across in the course of his missions. He add your operative’s edge bonus to Fortitude saves against poison and disease.

### Feats

- **Mobility**: +4 bonus to AC against AoO from movement

### Augmentations

- **Starfinder Society Subdermal Graft (right hand)**: This implant rests underneath the skin and can be activated/deactivated as a swift action.
  - activation causes a rendition of the Starfinder Society’s symbol to glow underneath the skin, acting as a mark that lets others know the bearer is a member of the Society
  - activation increases light level within 5ft by one step
- **Standard Datajack (brain)**: This cybernetic includes a programmable data port that allows Renlih to access different types of computers and digital storage media.
  - Any handheld computer can be inserted directly into the port, while larger systems need to be connected by an adapter cable.
  - Having the system connected directly to your nervous system obviates the need for an interface to access data on a system. Actually operating the system requires you to use the Computers skill as usual. Some closed systems don’t allow data access or require you to do some rewiring to connect with a datajack (usually an Engineering check).

### Proficiencies

- small arms
- sniper weapons

- Common, Ysoki, Shirren, Castrovelian
