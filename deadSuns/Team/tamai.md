## Abilities

### Racial

- **Skilled**: +1 skill rank at each level

### Tempered Pilgrim

- **Theme Knowledge**: Tamai has read and studied much in his eagerness to learn about and experience new cultures, and he often knows about them before he encounter them.
  - Reduce the DC of Culture checks to recall knowledge about a culture’s customs and related topics by 5.
  - whenever you take a rank in Culture, you learn to speak and read two new languages instead of one.
  - Culture is a class skill for you, though if it is a class skill from the class you take at 1st level, you instead gain a +1 bonus to Culture checks.

### Solarian

- **Skill Adept**: proficient in Culture and Survival
- **Solar Weapon**: Tamai can seize his solar mote in one hand to form a katana out of glowing stellar energy. Solarian weapon crystals can be applied.
  - solar weapon deals damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier.
  - Forming or dismissing a solar weapon is a move action that takes the same amount of effort as drawing or sheathing a weapon (and can be combined with a move as a single move action or used with the Quick Draw feat).
  - solar weapon is automatically dismissed if it ever leaves your hand.
  - No other creature or effect can affect your solar manifestation in any way, including disarming or sundering it.
- **Stellar Mode**: As long as you have 1 or 2 attunement points in a mode, you are attuned to that mode. Once you reach 3 attunement points in a mode, you become fully attuned to that mode.
	- **Graviton Mode**: When you enter graviton mode, you gain 1 graviton attunement point and become graviton-attuned. Some of your stellar revelations are graviton powers and get stronger if you’re graviton-attuned. While graviton-attuned, you gain a +1 insight bonus to Reflex saves.
	- **Photon Mode**: When you enter photon mode, you gain 1 photon attunement point and become photon-attuned. Some of your stellar revelations are photon powers and get stronger if you’re photon-attuned. While photon-attuned, you gain a +1 insight bonus to damage rolls (including damage rolls for your stellar powers).
	- **Unattuned**: While unattuned, you gain no attunement points and you are neither photon-attuned nor graviton-attuned. You lose all attunement points you’ve accrued so far and gain no benefits while unattuned.
- **Stellar Revelation**:
	- **Black Hole**: When you’re fully graviton-attuned, as a standard action, you can pull any number of creatures within 20 feet of you closer. You choose which creatures are affected and which ones aren’t. Each target must succeed at a **DC13 Fortitude** save or be pulled 10 feet toward you. The range of this revelation and the distance pulled increase by 5 feet at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter. Solid objects do not block this ability, but any creature that runs into a solid object ceases moving closer to you. Creatures moved by this ability do not provoke attacks of opportunity from this movement.
		- After you use this revelation, you immediately become unattuned.
		- Black hole functions as a zenith revelation for the purposes of abilities that reference them.
	- **Supernova (2d6)**: When you’re fully photon-attuned, as a standard action, you can deal 1d6 fire damage plus 1d6 additional fire damage per solarian level to all creatures within 10 feet of you. A creature that succeeds at a **DC13 Reflex** save takes half damage.
		- After you use this revelation, you immediately become unattuned.
		- Supernova functions as a zenith revelation for the purposes of abilities that reference them.

### Feats

- **Toughness**: For every character level Tamai has (and whenever he gains a new level), he gains 1 Stamina Point.
  - +4 bonus to Constitution checks to continue running, to avoid damage from a forced march, to hold your breath, and to avoid damage from starvation or thirst.
  - +4 bonus to Fortitude saving throws to avoid taking damage from hot or cold environments, to withstand the harmful effects of thick and thin atmospheres, to avoid choking when breathing in heavy smoke, and to avoid fatigue caused by sleep deprivation.
- **Coordinated Shot**: Allies gain a +1 bonus to ranged attacks against foes Tamai threatens but does not grant cover

### Augmentations

- **Starfinder Society Subdermal Graft (right hand)**: This implant rests underneath the skin and can be activated/deactivated as a swift action.
  - activation causes a rendition of the Starfinder Society’s symbol to glow underneath the skin, acting as a mark that lets others know the bearer is a member of the Society
  - activation increases light level within 5ft by one step

### Proficiencies

- light armor
- basic and advanced melee weapons
- small arms

### Languages

- Common, Akitonian, Castrovelian, Kasatha
