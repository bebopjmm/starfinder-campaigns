## Abilities

### Racial

- **Easily Augmented**: Verthani have spent a long time implanting devices into their bodies. A verthani can install an additional augmentation (cybernetics only) into one system that already has an augmentation.
- **Low-Light Vision**: Verthani can see twice as far as humans in conditions of dim light.
- **Skill Focus**: Verthani are highly skilled, though individually they tend to focus on a particular discipline.
- **Skin Mimic**: Verthani can manipulate the pigments in their skin at will and with astonishing precision, creating bright decorative patterns or deceptive camouflage. A verthani who stays stationary for 1 round gains a +10 racial bonus to Stealth checks (this bonus doesn’t stack with the invisibility spell or similar effects). If the verthani takes any action, he loses this bonus until he once again spends 1 round remaining still. A verthani wearing clothing or armor that covers more than one-quarter of his body can’t use this ability.

### Cyberborn

- **Theme Knowledge**: Mihyn enthusiastically studies the field of cybernetics and seeks to keep abreast of new applications and experimental technologies.
  - Reduce the DCs of Engineering checks to identify cybernetic augmentations and of Life Science checks to recall knowledge about cybernetic augmentation techniques, as well as corporations and other research facilities involved in the production of and experimentation with cybernetic augmentations, by 5.
  - +1 theme bonus to Computers checks.

### Mechanic (Exo-cortex)

- **Bypass (+1)**: Mihyn is skilled at getting inside computer systems and electronic devices and gains a +1 insight bonus to Computers and Engineering skill checks.
- **Custom Rig**: Mihyn has created a customized toolkit, installed as a cybernetic augmentation system in her brain, that she can use to hack systems and items.
  - While using this rig, she always count as having the appropriate tool or basic kit for any Computers or Engineering skill check she attempts.
  - she can use her custom rig as a Mk I comm unit
- **Artificial Intelligence**: Mihyn has an exo-cortex implanted within her brain that interacts with and augments her biological brain’s cognitive function
  - **Combat Tracking (BAB +2)**: As a move action during combat, Mihyn can designate a foe for her exocortex to track. As long as that target is in sight, the exocortex feeds her telemetry, vulnerabilities, and combat tactics, allowing her to make attacks against that target with base attack bonus equal to her mechanic level.
  - **Memory Module**: Once per day, as a reaction while not in combat, Mihyn can reroll a failed skill check to recall knowledge.
    - exocortex grants you the Skill Focus feat as a bonus feat. Every time you gain a mechanic level, you can rebuild your exocortex’s memory module, replacing the exocortex’s bonus Skill Focus feat with Skill Focus in a different skill.
- **Mechanic Tricks**
  - **Overclocking**: Mihyn has augmented the performance of her AI for maximum response timing.
    - +2 insight bonus to initiative checks and Reflex saves.

### Feats

- **Weapon Focus (longarms)**: +1 bonus to attack with longarms

### Augmentations

- **Technopathy Node (throat)**: A small metallic node etched with arcane symbols implanted in Mihyn's voice box allows her to silently vocalize messages to constructs with the technological subtype or to nearby computers designed to receive messages.
  - As a standard action, she can send a short message in a language she knows to up to three target creatures or computers she is observing within 100 feet and potentially receive a short reply, per telepathic message.
  - Alternatively, as a standard action, she can send a short message in a language she knows to a single target computer she is observing within 100 feet and have that computer display that message, allowing anyone observing that computer to read it without leaving any trace of the message’s origin.
- **Starfinder Society Subdermal Graft (right hand)**: This implant rests underneath the skin and can be activated/deactivated as a swift action.
  - activation causes a rendition of the Starfinder Society’s symbol to glow underneath the skin, acting as a mark that lets others know the bearer is a member of the Society
  - activation increases light level within 5ft by one step
